CHAPTER 1


Oh, it’s great! 
What a beautiful day! 
I love this place!

In many, many years in the past I have been here. I love this town.
I love this beach, La Mata beach. I love all the beaches.

I love the people on the beach, playing, sunbathing, relaxing, enjoying.
I love the children, especially the children, happiness, playfulness, their happy voices.

Especially I love to see the families together, having great time and joy.
And especially, I love the fact that nowadays there are mostly Spanish on the beach, at least here in Torrevieja area, in this lovely town.

There are lots of tourists, all around, but the best thing is that there are Spanish and locals as a majority. I still remember about thirty years ago how most of the people on the Spanish beaches were tourists, which was odd back then. I always hoped to have Spanish enjoying their time on their wonderful beaches. And now that time has come, which is truly great.

It’s wonderful to hear many, many languages, and people coming from different countries, different nationalities. I know many languages, about 9 in different levels, and hearing so many here sounds like music for my ears. 

I can recognize Spanish of course, a lot of English, as well as Eastern European, French spoken by French or Belgian, both more and more here... There are some Germans always, lots of people speaking some of Scandinavian languages, Swedish, Norwegian and even Finnish. Often there are some Italian, and I always feel I have to greet them with “ciao!” or “buon giorno!” I love Italian too.

I love the fact how many nationalities and languages I can hear here. It is wonderful how unbelievably multinational and international this little lovely town is. Actually, as thinking of it, this place is maybe one of the most multinational towns on the earth. Well, maybe Brussels is even more, but this town is definitely one of the most international towns on the world. In fact there are people living here from over 30 different nationalities, and that’s a lot. Great!

I love the sea, the waves reaching the beach on the sea shoreline, the sound of the sea.
I love the sea, the people swimming and playing, just floating or jumping against the waves, doing water sports, some surfing, some paddling, on the other beaches many wind boarding, going out for diving.

I love the horizon, jet-skis, boats and some cargo ships further on. The most I love the horizon and the eternity it represents, the horizon line looking like the edge, but actually being the beginning of the world exploration, the promise of the fascinating world and endless adventures. I love the sea, its force and might, everlasting movement, even the colors.

I’m smiling, feeling a great intake of the fresh air, and as I see it the energy. There is a magical energy on the beaches, all free for everybody. It’s about sense of good feelings, the sea, fresh air, sunshine, free positive energy.

Four kids playing the beach football, their ball escaping towards me…
I kick the ball back to them, “gracias!” they shout at, and I dodge a little to give them space, continuing my walk. 

I absolutely love long beach walks, barefoot, the sand massaging my foot bottoms. I have used to do long walks barefoot, sometimes only four kilometers, sometimes ten or fifteen, but it always being my regular habit, almost in daily basis, when staying or living at the seaside, within any reasonable proximity of the sea.

As being a beach person, always been, one time almost practically lived on the beach or just next to the beaches, spent the best times in my live on the beachside… And as being a swimmer and diver, loving the boats… I must say that I truly love it, this, all of this.

I’m continuing my walk, coming already back from my turning point “the Torrevieja”, an actual Torre de Vieja, “Old Tower”, old little turret standing on the shoreline on its own.

I have done this twice today, two kilometers long La Mata beach between my two turning points, rocks and rocky shoreline on the other end continuing towards the actual Torrevieja town, and Torre de Vieja tower and plaza on the other end. It is four kilometers back and forth, eight as I’ve done it twice already.

Just right now, I have come about two hundred meters back from Torre de Vieja, walking fast forward as always, letting my legs to do all the sports…

But now something is distracting me.
A little detail, just a sudden sight on my right eye corner, something unfamiliar, something different from usual… 
About seventy meters away from me.

I see hundreds of the people on the beach, all around, actually even thousands as thinking of the whole huge about hundred meters wide and two kilometers long beach. I see hundreds of the children, people of all ages, all enjoying of their Sunday afternoon. Most of them are on a holiday, having a great time with their loved ones.

I see a nice children’s playground area with equipments and the children playing there. I see lots of sun beds and sun shades in a rental area and all full of the people. 

So great, so lovely, so peaceful…

But that little detail a bit further on the beach, just next to the little dunes, is distracting me.
It cracks the pretty much perfect picture on my mind, alarming my instincts, telling me disruptive signs… 

And I must say that I very much dislike that feeling, alarming instinct ringing the bells on my mind here, here on this wonderful beach, among all these people, the children.

Four men in black suits, looking like wetsuits. But something different, some special gears.

They have bags on their hands each of them.

Are they sportsmen, going out for a dive, snorkels and flippers in their bags?

I would think so, but their posture, their movement, some kind of alertness, a tense on their behavior… 

That’s the detail which is alarming me.
And when my instincts are alarming in this way, in a warning way, I very much dislike it happening here.

My instincts are mostly right, and when I’m getting this alarm on my mind, in this kind of great place full of the people… 
It makes me worrying.

Maybe the alarm is false, just a detail which is distracting me, a little cheeseburger worth of forgetting straight away.

I’m walking ahead, my pace slowing down a little, feeling like I would like to stop, just for a moment to have a look, a bit better look.

Just as thinking of it I stop walking. 

I’m looking at the sea and the people, being just like everybody on the beach, but I’m also following those four men still on sight on the corner of my eyes.

Are they just as everybody, going to have fun, maybe doing sports as that’s how they look like? Or what are they actually doing here?

They look a bit suspicious.

The first thing is that they all have exactly the same costume, kind of wetsuits, but some a bit odd looking clothing, on them. It looks like a black training costume, covering the full body, including the head. 

Why would four men use exactly the same wetsuits as normally people are individuals and everyone has got their own taste?

To me, the same outfit with all the guys resembles me of some official such like the military, police or special force. Having exactly the same outfit makes four men being a group of something unifying. It makes their outfit purposely chosen, and when there is a special outfit for anything, there is a purpose too.

Almost laughing at my thoughts on my mind, trying to tell myself that I’m silly now, just too cautious, overreaching my preparedness…

But there are more disruptive signs, such as their coordinated movement.

Ordinary people in groups are always moving “flexibly”. Even when being in the group and going into the same direction. All the people are individuals, and they have their own ways of move and communicate with the others. They are very much just naturally what they are, each of them.

But when trained people, a group of individuals, having repeated trained movements especially when moving in a group… 
That’s completely something different.

And even though, those four men are clearly trying to be just like the others, it’s easy to see their trained and coordinated minds working together, being linked with each other.

In that well trained world, everything is based on certain automation, and when the persons are well trained, over and over again, repeated certain movements endless of times, being coordinated with the others in their group, that makes their posture very different from the ordinary people, to me.

Who knows and who has been involved in the same, can recognize it on the others.

I’m still standing but turning a little bit around as looking at the people on the beach. At the moment, the trained part of me is starting to play my own role now, as I’m being “just like anyone else here”. It’s like a game.

A main point is to avoid them to notice anything alarming on my behavior, just in case.

How silly I am I think. They are just four normal guys coming to the beach, having some sports gears on their black bags, towels and maybe some snacks. Just like everybody.

But as thinking of my silliness, those four “ordinary” guys stop from walking. They are looking around, scoping their surrounding, all in a well coordinated way… even too well. And that “too well” is a part what worries me.

Silly or whatever, but the alarm on my mind is now ringing red. False or accurate, hopefully fully false, is the tension rising in my body and my mind. Adrenaline starting to run onto my veins, the hearth’s pace accelerating, all alarms on at the moment…

But why, what’s so alarming in this?
Why a heck is this happening now?
What on earth is going on?

That’s what I think at the moment.

Very worrying thoughts are popping up on my mind, one after the other. In a way it’s senseless, as it is just a normal wonderful day, the beach full of the people, all enjoying their time and their life, especially the children.

And as thinking of that, trying to convince myself of my silly instincts fooling me, all of a sudden I get it. 
“Whatever, it’s my call now” I think.

There is always a scenario, in all, sometimes the worst scenario, sometimes just a scenario, sometimes false alarm, but sometimes a reality and a real threat…

But in a moment like this, hundreds of children on the beach, the people loving of their time, the best time in their life… In a case there are all alarms on, instincts telling about the threat, something being wrong, there is a choice to make.

And what are my choices?
What can I do?
What am I going to do?

Continuing my walk, just going on and away from this situation now, and ignoring all the bells, all the disruptive signs… 

Maybe ridiculing it on my mind, laughing at my silliness, rationalizing it being overreacting, and just letting it be, completely ignoring the whole thing.

Well, “Shit” I think.

Now feeling tense, excitement, adrenaline reforming my mind and preparedness…
I let the word burst out from my mouth, depicting the whole thing and what I think about it, “Fuck!”

And I start approaching the four men, now standing and observing their surrounding, them standing just a few meters from the little dunes area and the fence around it, next to the safeguards little wooden cabin…

I take my sight a bit aside from them, repeating myself, swearing the whole thing on my mind, thinking that this must be some bad luck scenario now. Hot red alarming bells are rising the chances it being a “bad luck case”.

“Fuck! I say again, starting to walk towards to the boardwalk on the beach, leading in or out, in this case passing by the four men. I step on the boardwalk, look down, peak them, still swearing on my mind, but feeling now adrenaline affirming my determination. 

“Fuck, whatever it is, I’ll take this call.”

I’ll check, hoping it’s all false, but…




















CHAPTER 2


I start walking towards the four men, along the boardwalk, at first slowly, but now accelerating my pace.

Things are raging on my mind, “what if?”

My instincts are alarming hot red. At the same time I’m rationalizing and telling myself that it’s impossible that anything like my fears now are would ever happen.

It’s way too great here, all the people, the children, happy voices, people playing and enjoying their time. 

How would anyone ever ruin that or do something so unbelievably horrible?

So cruel, so brutal, so mad!

Something like, as terrible as that, the worst possible scenario, which is now raging on my mind… Are they going to commit the worst ever kind of terrorist act?

There have been cases, in Africa, on the beach resorts, actually on the beach, exactly in the places like this, in the very same situations than now here…

I’m thinking that I must be the mad one here. How can I even think something like that being possible…? In Europe!?

But on the other hand, bad, very bad things have happened in the last few years, more and more, serious well coordinated terror attacks, all kind of acts of violence, everyday terrorism, terror reaching a kind of “new normal” status in the people’s lives. 

And what’s the craziest in all, the politicians are accepting it and somehow facilitating the whole thing, normalizing it all, and saying, that “it’s just how the things are nowadays, get used to it”. 

That kind of utter stupidity and madness makes me seeing red, pure hot red. Are they just incompetent to prevent and do anything to secure people’s lives, or is it all about politics? But that’s real madness.

And that’s my “the worst scenario” here…
A terror attack, similar than those recently in Africa, shootings and massacres on the beaches, targeting the innocent people, but also the most important industry, tourism…

I hope I’m wrong. I must be wrong!
It’s too bad to be true. I must be wrong!

As my thoughts are raging I’m approaching closer to the four men. My heart is bouncing rapidly, pumping the adrenaline filled blood into my veins, filling me with alertness, naturally doped strength, excess human resources, normal abilities exceeding powers.  I’m getting doped with the body’s own drugs, the most powerful of all.

Possibly terrorists, the most severe terror act, four trained men, possibly machine guns, shootout, bloodshed, massacre…

I must be mad myself. 
How can I even think the possibility like that?

I must have seen too many things in my past, too many action filled movies, too many imaginary acts of violence, too much.

I would laugh at myself, my thoughts, my silliness, my own overreaching imaginary creating “the worst scenario possibilities”.

But, my instincts were telling me that something is badly wrong, still are. And when my instincts are telling me things, I take it. They have saved me so many times, my life. I’ll give the highest respect to them.

I’m walking forward, slowly, playing my role. Looking around, smiling, paying a bit more attention to the group of sexy chicks. I’m just a normal guy, walker, sun-seeker, holiday-maker, old foe, retired…

Then I get a sudden alarm on my mind, my copycat army pants… I’m wearing old army style shorts, what about that I think.

I must ignore it, everyone is in these days. It’s just a normal fashion. As for a confirmation, I look around and I see that the ones wearing this kind of “normal fashion”… Well, it’s only me. All others have got swimming trunks, beach shorts, only that... 
Yep, I see, I’m also the only one wearing the grayish-bluish sleeveless t-shirt. 

“Shit” I think, just in case. It hardly signals anything to them. And the hope that the ringing bells on my mind are ridiculously wrong, who cares what I’m wearing…

At the same time, with my raging thoughts, approaching the four men in “kind of” black wetsuits, I look at them, having one “a bit too long peek”. But at once it’s done I must be straight and just look at them for a short moment, as otherwise my escaping glance would alarm them, surely.

Now when I look at the men, being only about ten meters from them, my ringing bells start banging, banging hard. The signs what I see are worse that I was expecting. As long as I had an excuse on my mind that “everything is fine”, I felt a bit more released and relaxed.

But now, that seriousness…?
The signs I see now… 

When seeing their burning hot staring eyes, firm strict and unsmiling faces, frozen posture, stiffness, alertness… Black bags on the sand in front of them…

I know as surely as anything can be that something is badly wrong with these guys.

And at the very same moment, one of them is staring at me, our eyes hit each others.
And at the very same blink of an eye, we, in one tenth of a second, we both realize the same disturbing thing. 

Our common understanding is admirable, our eyes stick into each other, his anger and kind of sudden surprised flash realization, meets my determination, straight forward look, craziness of preparedness of action.

At the very same moment we both realize what we are, what we are facing in each other, and also both knowing that what is going to happen next.

Only one practical word flashes red bells on my mind, “fuck”.
And then things, reality check kind of facts, are flashing on my mind…

I made my choice. I would have walked away, but instead of doing so my decision was to “check”. And now there is only one option left, it’s to bear the consequences.

I’m now only five meters away, still heading to pass by them. But this one guy, his mind blowing meeting with my eyes, is now reaching down towards his black bag, him alerting his pals at the same time, I must scoot.

I jump forward, as fast as my old trained limbs can transport my body.

The guy whose eyes I met, rips his bag open, three other guys crab their bags, take rapid step away, going to deploy further from the one which alerted them. They all start reaching something from inside their bags, all at the same time.

I’m registering their movements, but this one guy is a few seconds ahead of all the others. He is my severest threat now, clearly. I’m unarmed, and for sure he’s reaching some hardcore black metal from his bag, groping it just right now.

I’m only two meters away and I see it. This idiot has got a machine gun, pulling it out from his bag as fast as he can, apparently going to point it on me, kill me.

And in a very same moment I realize that this is the most factual truth happening now. I’ve seen it many times, but now it’s in a completely wrong place I think. And as thinking of it, it only makes my determination stronger, bursting adrenaline, filling the blood with it, every cell.

And as that happens, I’m only the follower of my own mind and body, when the instincts take action. Clear thinking and consideration are wiped out and there are only well trained reactions left.

I see him having his gun now, removing the safety catch, lifting the barrel up. 
Also, I kind of thank him, as he is reaching up, lifting his body rapidly into the upper position. I thank him for giving me one extra second, a bit better chance.

Instead of dropping down on his knees, and just shooting at me from the best ever position, he is using the most valuable second for standing up, at the same time as I’m just about to reach him.

I’m also thanking that this idiot has got a machine gun. If he had a pistol I would be dead already, but “luckily” he got “only” a machine gun. It’s good for possible maximal bloodshed but bad for the close combat situations.

I see his victorious smile as he prepares to pull the trigger. I realize it, even though it’s only my reactions on charge now, regarding to anything happening.

His smirk flashes on my eyes, victorious sureness of killing me, his finger squeezing the trigger now, me going to be killed.

I hit the gun barrel wiping it aside to the right, slightly down, his gun now bursting out flares, bullets hitting the sand.

I dive on to the left, our bodies touching each others, me grapping his chin with my right hand, pulling him along me, gun flares reaching higher, me ignoring his gun, totally, just reacting.

We are falling down, now both backwards, my firm fingers squeezing his jaw, other arm behind his neck…

And before we are down on our back, in one pile, he still on me, his neck snaps with nasty sound, he being death, followed an instant sentence I have offered for him.

Now I’m interested in having his gun, grapping it from his death sloppy fingers, rolling his body on its side, to cover mine.

At the very same moment I can feel bullets hitting the body in front of me, both being down, my shooting position being almost the worst possible. And I hope that the bullets nudging the body are only hitting the death man’s armory... 

Really?

As realizing that he’s got the body armor I’m thankful again. AK-47 machine guns which they are firing, peppering me now with big nasty bullets, all three of them, only about five meters from me…

Without the body armor I would be already death as well. 

Still on my right side, lying on the ground, tightly together and behind the death man’s body, I take my time.

AK-47 bullets peppering around, nudging our bodies, especially the one covering me up, some perhaps hitting me too, most of them ending up to the sand, tens of bullets being pure waste…

I point the gun, pull the trigger the first time, and I hit the first man’s forehead middle of his eyes, a fresh hole appearing in it.

As his already death finger squeezing the trigger, the gun still bursting the bullets but now more towards to the sky, my second bullet hits the second man’s forehead. Missing exactly in the middle but almost, but good enough anyway, I think. 

The man’s head swings backwards leading his already death body to the same way.

The third man gets exactly the same sentence with exactly the same pattern, my third bullet terminating his vicious actions.

Only a few seconds more, their bodies falling down, practically almost at the same time, me staring at the magnificent moment… there comes silence, a complete silence…

All the guns silenced, flares stopped, bullets bursting all around the place, finished…

What a beautiful silence?

The next thing I realize is that I’ve got a hit. 
That “beautiful silence” is changing its form now. Burning hot pain on my hip, on the left side, is hitting my brains hard, lightning hard, as an electric shock.

But only for a very short moment, as the mind is blowing its own procedures now. A well trained automation of the brains function taking its place, flushing my mind with a counter-reaction

It’s blocking the pain, adrenaline overtaking all of it, even endorphin releasing its effectiveness, nice but still warm numbness filling the pain’s place on my brains.

“Fuck!”
“But good job” I think.
“Well done my pal, thanks.”

I realize I was lucky, very lucky, at this time. The same lucky strike hit again, which has hit me many times before. 

Suddenly, still feeling thankful I start realizing the horror, screaming people, women’s terrible panicking voices, children’s loud cry out, total panicking, ears and mind hurting screech being the worst. 

A new kind of panic is filling my skin now, bursting goose-flesh all over my body. Hitting my consciousness with the reality, realizing it’s all too bad to be true.

What a hell has happened here?















CHAPTER 3


Everything is different now!

All those children, the people enjoying the most beautiful perfect day in their life, all in ruins now…

Everything is different from the secret missions, specialists at the certain facilities, the combat situations on the battlefield. 

“Oh gosh! It’s a real world here.”

Still lying on my side on the ground, terrorist’s death body in front of me, three other death bodies on their backs, blood running out of my wound, my hand pressuring it down, I’m looking around… 

Running and screaming people all over the beach, escaping in a full panic to the different directions, hardly anyone really knowing that what has happened and where…

They all heard the loud shooting sounds, they all realized the nightmare is being a reality, they all panicked trying to find safe, they all scrambled from their positions, they all reacted pretty much in the exactly the same ways… Full Panic!

The first my scoping sight picks up a few people nearby, lying down on the sand. Are they death, I think, as that’s the worst thing which I would imagine? I hope they are okay.

I see them moving, one by one, lifting their heads, gone just down as a reaction to seek safety and protection. Some maybe got an accidentally hit of a bullet, but they are all moving and that’s important here. 

All of those running are fine, maybe badly scared, still panicking, but as long as they are running, it’s all fine for me.

But, also, I see a few on the ground, whining or yelling help, and that’s bad. But, another but, as long as they all keep yelling it’s better than the worst.

While still lying down myself, now feeling relief as realizing that innocent deaths have been avoided… “Great!” 

Only four lives have been taken, an act I voluntarily offered to them, four men which lives were crucially necessary to terminate, now all being the threats eliminated.

Or is it?

On a corner of my eye I see one man wearing a black jacket, about hundred meters from me, looking around, a phone on his hand…

Black jacket? 
It’s 36 degrees hot!

He turns around, going to go away.

I squeeze my hip, trying to stand up, standing up, thanking that I’m okay enough to do so, taking the first testing step, supporting myself with the machine gun against the ground.

I see him walking away, and despite of the bullet wound on my hip, I know I have to follow him. He has been possibly filming the whole thing, perhaps being one of them.

And as he is leading his way away from here it’s pretty much sure, he is one of them.

And that means that there are more. 
It also means that the whole thing was well planned and coordinated. It was well organized to be exploited in the most severe and deathly consequences, bloody massacre.

Their terror plan was to cause maximal destruction, kill bunches of the innocent people, deploy a full scale massacre, maybe tens of holidaymakers killed, maybe more…

Well, only an unexpected factor, the most unlikely thing, changed their plans completely, crucially, deathly, with three one by one snap shots served.

They would call it back luck which hit them hard, bad luck for them but good luck for the others, good lucky strike for hundreds of the innocent people.

Their terrorist plan met one madman, uncalculated reaction, deed of the duty, strong will to save children’s lives, all the people’s lives…

And the dirtiest possible terror act was foiled, miserably failed, unsuccessful to them.

But luckily that’s the reality at the moment. The terror plot, terrible terrorist act, the most severe massacre… has been foiled.

One man walking away, apparently one of them, me limping after him…

I’m afraid there might be some more action in front of me, action I just have to see through.

Different thoughts are now raging on my mind, understanding how lucky I was when surviving that senseless shootout. I thank for being alive, I would say miraculously.

Numerous of questions are popping up on my mind, my lips whispering hissing questions, anger with hardcore adrenalin accelerating its pace on my mind and body again…

What’s behind all of this? 
Who are these terrorists?
How many are they?
Are they some other coordinated attacks?

Where are the police? 
Sirens, I’m missing those beautiful sirens now. In this situation they would be highly welcome, sound like the most wanted songs…

But silence in that sense, only the people’s screaming voices, masses of them running away from the beach, most of them still in full panic mode…

The missing silence hits the reality, police, please come, there is always police close by here in Spain. Where are they now?

Some people are faster than I am, overtaking me, running, my pace fitted with the man’s pace walking with steady fast pace about fifty meters in front of me.

And as seeing the people running into the same direction that I’m going, following the man, I realize that they are maybe running towards the troubles. I’m expecting to find some more of the terrorists, as this one man hardly is heading off towards the loneliness. There must be some others there.

As ignoring the questions, making sure that the man is on my sight I start calculating my changes. I’ve got the gun now and I have trust into it, but how many are they? Am I running towards even more problems?

Yes, I realize that there are lots of problems now. The police sirens which I’m so much willing to hear, mean bunches of new troubles to me too… 

I was on a holiday, retired, enjoying my time in the best possible way, being and walking on the beach. My idea was very simple, take it easy and enjoy the life.

But now, that what just happened, ruins absolutely everything. Even though I should be seen as a hero, I understand that, there will be endless barrage of questions asked, massive publicity, over too much attention, privacy gone, all that sweetness with sunny days, that what I only wanted to have, from my simple and enjoyable time spending.

Suddenly, my eyes catch the white van, which I think the man is approaching. Somehow, I just know that that’s the van he is heading to. In a way it has been parked, ready to go with free space in front of it, or something. Maybe the straight line towards the van the man has taken, and, his walking pace is clearly accelerating now… 

But I know that that’s the van for sure.

At the same time the man starts running, only a short way from the van, and that nails the point here. The thing I was suspicious of has become the fact. They have an escape van, and that means that their plan was to cause a sudden massacre and then succeed to escape. 

They have had a plan to escape…

Some terrorists have got explosives and their plan is to blow up themselves too, but these were going to get away. Their plan was to be safe, shoot and kill a mass of completely innocent people with the machine guns, and then escape to the safe for themselves.

It also means that they possibly have a full plan for further to get away and hide, with multiple vehicles, money resources, all organized… And that actually makes the whole thing even more serious.

At the same time when the man is just about reach the van I can hear its motor starting. That puts me on the run, instead of running away from something it makes me running towards to the serious action once again. 

When now scooting forward, the AK-47 comfortably on my grip, I’m thinking that I thought I’ll learn and that I can stay away from the problems, but I see that my clear nature to find extreme situations works again.

Despite of the wound on my hip, yet unchecked, bleeding, I jump a few long leaps forward. And when the van’s side door opens, the man just about getting in, the motor now revving up, my last leap reaches further, just enough to be able to hit his neck with the hard wood of the AK-47. 

The man faints instantly. But the other one in back of the van, his surprised eyes staring at me, is shouting out loud “go”, apparently alarming the driver…

“In English?” 

The sudden realization hits my understanding at the same time when I hit the AK’s barrel close to bunch it into his mouth my fingertip pulling the trigger, with a simple plan to blow up his brains.

But one of the most reliable gun in the world, one of the cheapest as well, one the most used… jams. 

“Fuck” I think, and push the guns barrel now into his mouth with full force. It’s boring a hole through the soft flesh in the back of his throat. As lifting it up the effectiveness is about the same than the bullet, it almost blowing up his brains. 

Another man, next to the driver, is now turning his handgun, good old fashioned semi-automatic Clock, towards me.

I’m giving him a serious blow with my elbow, my fingers taking a firm grip of the hand with the gun, turning it forcefully towards the driver, my trigger finger triggering the bullet, only one but enough, hitting the driver’s temple, sending his soul into its last trip straight to the hell.

Something squeezing into my left eye, dirty finger, my head banging against metal, the gun in his hand now smashing against my right eye, him forcefully using it as a hammer to smash my face…

My foot slips, me falling on my butt, him holding me head between his hand and arm, me knowing what’s going to be his next move, his arms squeezing tight my artery, or to snap my dear neck…

My position is bad, very, very bad.

I managed to kill a few of them, but now it seems to be my turn, my head being in a complete lockdown, definite kill grip on my enemy’s unbelievably strong hands. 

He’s twisting my head backwards, trying to rip it off from my shoulders, that causing me a hell of a pain on my back.

His arm now blocking my breath, squeezing my artery, my head close to pop out of its position, his smelly breath sticking my nose, his laughing forcing its way into my ears…

The hard truth reality check hits my brains now, my reactions seemingly slow as the eternity, trying to figure out the last chance to save myself, my right hand still holding his hand with the gun, blocking it from putting the final bullet into my head.

At the same time as feeling it coming, black numbness out of lack of the oxygen, trying to pull my other hand free from the squeeze it is, totally locked between my own body and the back of the front seat…

The unexpected happens, I kind of fain, fall numb, releasing the grip of the gun, falling completely emotionless, his firm arms now holding me, squeezing even more, the last of the last bit of the life out of me.

My position was too bad, me being absolutely unable to do anything at all, his reactions being better, me being a killer of already four of them at the beach, tree of them in the van… but now, me facing the end of my endeavors, inevitably.

He’s still holding my floppy body in his tight grip, shaking me as a dead rag, growling as a black bear, making sure I’m death, as dead as dead can be.










CHAPTER 4 


The knife.

There was a knife on the hip of the other man, the one which got the barrel into his brains.

His body fallen onto the floor.

My floppy body falling next to him now.
Released by the killer of me.

My right hand fingers grabbing the knife.

Gasping breath, reacting as having and electric shock, emerging in life again.

Sticking the knife into my killer’s throat.
Blood bursting out.

And that’s the end of his story, at the same time as mine gets a new beginning.

I had to risk everything!

There was the only one chance left, my options were all gone, without a single opportunity to fight back. I was gone, fatally gone. Then the last of the last tricks ever tried took place. Fake your death, and save yourself.

It worked. 

He’s dead and I’m alive, but just barely.

Without knowing anything at all about anything at all anymore, trying to gasp more air, reviving my veins with fresh oxygen, coming back to the life, I start realizing a thing again.

Turning towards the front, looking for the gun, old good Clock, now pulling the knife out of his throat, willing to keep it, trying to clear my thoughts, thinking…

I see a black backpack, I see the gun, I take the both. At the same time as putting the gun and the knife into the back, I look around. The van is practically empty. And I realize the fact that there is absolutely zero evidence of anything here. It’s all in vain even to try to find any.

These are professionals and that’s for sure, take it. They have minimalist of anything, only what’s crucially needed. It’s all just waste of the time to try to find the driving license of the driver, or passports. And if there anything would be found, it’s all fake anyway.

Only purpose that they would have anything in the first escape car is that it’s simply being planted there for the distraction.

But one thing there is, and that’s what I want.

The phone.

As collecting the last energy resources of my body to move, to find the phone and to get away from here, I have about only one serious thought left, “shit”. 

I hit a real shit at this time.
And it’s going to take a toll to get away and along with it.

I see the phone on the ground and I take it. If anything of anything, it will be in this phone. And even though I doubt it, I still want to have it, just in case.

Now looking around, seeing people filming me with their phones…

What a fuck?!

They are filming me.

They start cheering, at first one, then the others, then lots of them. The people are cheering and kind of celebrating. Unbelievable!

Being stunned, completely stunned now, trying to collect the last pieces of some sense here, sense in all senselessness what have happened, me now being a film star, the celebrated action movie hero in a real life… there is only one reasonable sentence to describe all of my thoughts in one.

“Fuck!”

That’s the most serious thought I can put out at this very remarkable moment.

I would smile if I could. But instead of silly gestures like that I put the backpack on my shoulder, collect the pieces of myself together, still peaking once into the van if I can see anything but in vain, thinking that it’s done what’s done…

So, “Gracias! It’s time to go.

Then there are the sirens now, somewhere, finally, but for me, there is only one thing to do, disappear. That’s the final conclusion I got just right now. It’s time to go, and disappear, vanish.

But, for some reason, I have to do at least one little gesture, and I bow slow and deep bow to the cheering people. Then turning away, realizing that some of them start to come closer, me now shoving the sign to stay away. The last thing needed here is some encounter with numerous of people and celebrations of killings of the terrorists, terminative acts which I have just very recently delivered.

One of the most sure things in this world is that that would be another nightmare.

There is enough for now, it’s time to go.

I start running. Yep. Even though I’m complete wreck, kind of a pile of meatballs, hit by the bullet at least once, totally beaten up, my face apparently smashed, being killed already once “died but revived”…

Yep, I start running.

There are some serious miracles in this world, and the one is a human body and its resources. 

Well trained mind with trained body, with the abilities to exceed the normality, normal human powers, even multiple times.

Yep, that’s the world wonder one, human mind and body with its almost unlimited flexibility and powers.

As using those powers now, doped with the strongest hormones in the world, adrenaline and endorphin, and many others still unknown, along with the unbelievably strong mind powers, in a perfect combination called human body and mind… I’m running away.

Luckily I know the whole place, surroundings, the whole town very well. I know where to go, I just need to go.

Running away is the best thing to do now. Nice long run as far from here as possible. And as saying so I mean long, long run away from here, form this place, from this town, maybe from the country.

This nice “rocky run” also gives me time to think, as I realize I truly have to think now.

I love the beaches the most, but I love the seashore rocks too, and I know I must head off to the rocks now.

The route ahead is forming its shape on my mind now. I must get back to my hotel as I need something from there. And the way to the hotel, Masa Hotel… The way there is going to be such a rocky run. 

The only choice actually, as with the current beaten up bloody posture I have on me now, what else I can do than to avoid the people. The best would be just to hide into the bushes, and move at night, but at first I’ll have to get further away from here.

Long time ago, in my best shaped days, I used to run on the rocks a lot, running like a gazelle, it being the best ever training for me, combined with the forest runs, and especially freestyle climbing the cliffs, conquering all the highest I found… But my ageing retired body has lost its best shape.

Anyway, I must go to the rocks now. 

That what has happened here now will pull out all the people from the beaches and the rocks next to the TV screens, as everybody will follow the news. And as there are rarely TV’s on the shoreline, anything else than hardcore rocks, that’s the best place for me.

I also understand that I’ll have to find a hideout to stay for the rest of the day. I’ll have to peep into the hotel overnight, and it must be done in a way to avoid anyone seeing me.

I must disappear, completely. That’s the best of the best to do now.

With these plans, running away from those terrible events, hearing the sirens now, absolutely everywhere, heading towards the La Mata Park, as I call it…

It’s a lovely place, lots of pine trees, water pond, water stream, walking ways… Actually its name is the “Parque del Molino del Aqua”, the “Watermill Park”. I’ll have to run across it. Only the last block left running on the street and I’m reaching there. 

Hearing the sirens everywhere, but otherwise being unbelievably quiet right here as there are only some people around to be seen.

For sure there is still full panic on the beach, the beaches, on the streets, everywhere, as the people are trying to get away and safe. And as thinking of it I’m realizing that I’ll have to get back to the beach anyway, to get into the rocks. That makes me to consider the option to stay on the streets, but I choose the rocks. 

It will be quieter there. And when I’m the only one there, it’s fine for me.

Now running through the La Mata Park, thinking of getting back in sight with the people, with my bloody posture…

The water bond on the right, yep that’s it, I know where it is.

That lovely pond is going to change its color a little, but I’ll have to wash off all the blood on me. And the best way to do it is to jump into the pond, roll over a few times, rub my wounds, wash the t-shirt, all very, very quickly, and then go on.

As thinking of plunging into the water I touch the wound on my hip with my fingers…

The bullet?

Still running, just about reaching to the pond soon, already seeing it, all quiet here which is great, I also touch the back of my hip. And I realize that there is another bullet hole in my body, so I got at least two new holes I think.

But good, good luck again. It’s great to have two holes when being shot at. The one delivered when the bullet punched in and the other when it came out. That’s the lucky strike here. The bullet has to be taken out and the best is that it is boring its own way out straight away from the other side.

Okay, having a hole through the body would be bad, but as the fact is that I’m just about going to jump into the pool, after fighting with the four terrorists in the van by bare hands, then run half a mile to do what I’m doing just right now, gleefully leaping straight head first into the water…

Yep, right, I’m still alive.
And that’s what’s great here.

If the wound was anything too bad, too serious of its class, sudden death, this trip would have been ended up into the ditch next to the road, or on the bottom of the van.

Lucky being here, having a refreshing wash-up, getting rid of the blood all over me, having the bullet holes on my hip all the way from front to the back, through my mid body, the face being meaty bloody flesh, completely smashed…

Yep, I’m happy to be alive!






















CHAPTER 5


Floating now on my back, in the pond. 

Thinking, thinking hard.

But weirdly, somehow enjoying the refreshing water tendering my sore smashed and riddled body. Plunging my face underwater, still rubbing the blood off, mixing it with the turquoise water, now changing its color to reddish… Yep, how enjoyable...

This luxury is very limited for me now. Must go! Must vanish from here, from this place, from this town.

The thoughts on my mind are very simple. Must go, must go on. 

But where to go, what are my options?

Find a hideout here, stay, wait for weeks, let things cool down, and then move.

Plunging my beaten up face underwater once again, kind of trying to reset the thoughts, it’s pretty easy to figure out that there will be zero “cool down” in this heat. 

The heat of the news, many men dead…

Wait, actually… with easy calculation I get eight dead men it total. That’s actually a huge number in such a short time. All armed with the machine guns, 4+4 against one…

Well done pal, I must admit to myself.

But it was just a reaction, far from anything I ever wanted to happen, me having the easy go relaxing days of the well earned retirement.

Bad things happen, and that happened to happen just right there where I was enjoying my best ever retirement time.

And as thinking of it, it’s hardly difficult to figure out that all that is gone, completely gone, wiped out just like that. Everything will be different now, from now on, and there is absolute zero chance to go back to normal.

So…

HUH!

The best ever wisdom pushes its way through my aging brain cells… It’s better to go.

I stand up, step on the pond’s edge, grab my backpack from the ground, look around 360 degrees, being the only one here, just like I want it to be.

But it’s time to get back to the beach, to the rocks, to the hotel, to… where.

“Fuck”

I start running again, jogging actually, without too much hurry, rather looking like an average jogger, unaware of anything what has happened on the La Mata beach, being just a lonely man on his daily exercise course.

I’m heading off towards the rocks, La Mata Beach as I say, even though the actual La Mata is on the opposite end of the exactly two kilometer long beach strip between the rocks, my turning point rocks.

I’m used to walk the two kilometer strip almost in a daily basis, from the rocky shore on the Torrevieja’s end to the plaza with a little very old Torre de Vieja turret, two kilometers as done once, four as back and forth, eight kilometers when done twice…

I love it, absolutely love it!
But, it’s all gone, easy to understand, for me it’s all gone now. Without a serious facelift surgery, there is zero chance for me to ever do it again, at least in the near future of a full decade.

Things have changed now. In a few moments, sudden earthquake of the life, absolutely everything has changed.

The future I see in front of me, hard truth to be face to face, is that I must escape, and keep escaping. I’ll have to find a place, far from here, peaceful enough, elsewhere in this world, to be able to go on with the retirement plan I was already executing.

I see some people now, an elderly couple. I’ll past them thinking that they must be wondering that where are all the people? Still continuing jogging, just arriving on the edge of the dunes, then seeing it…

A chaos…

Lifeguards hasting people off from the beach, people collecting their stuffs in full disbelief of the chaos, multiple police cars with flashing lights, sirens, someone maybe hurt in the chaos, people rushing away from the beach…

The only word to describe the events I see is chaotic. And as thinking of it, it must be the same everywhere. The police and all available units of any emergency departments in this town must have been deployed.

As the terrorist attack happened on the beach, to avoid similar co-attacks elsewhere they’ll have to empty all the beaches, and get the people safe from the possible threat. And as being so the whole town must be in some kind of a chaos now, tens of thousands of people, thousands of vehicles, all suddenly on the move at the same time. The whole place must be jamming, blocked, it only causing even more fear and anxiety. 

What a horrible thing the whole thing…

Still continuing my jogging, very well fitting with all the other people in kind of a full scale rampage, rushing around, actually all to the different directions…

Must say that my little hurry to get away fits perfectly into this neighborhood!

Now in the end of the beachfront promenade, continuing to the beach, passing by the beach restaurant “Chirinquito”, the staff hurrying up for closing it, unable to serve me the coffee I used to have there.

I’m almost laughing out loud when seeing the writing on the restaurant’s wall “Smile, You are in the Paradise”. Just continuing, passing by the beach volleyball courts I used to play, heading off towards to the surf container, seeing Miquel there collecting the paddling and surfing boards in a big hurry. 

Obviously, he must get them all into the container before going by the orders of the police. He’s only about fifty meters away from me, straight ahead, the beach being practically about empty already. 

He sees me, smiling and waving in a way he always does. A great guy I think, Torrevieja Surf, the best around here. At the same time when approaching past him, already regretting the fact that my well great paddling sessions here are done for now, for the time being in the future.

He says me something, I realize he’s asking that what has happened, me replying in Spanish “the terrorist attack”, he looking very worried and saying “really?”

Me going to pick up the board from the waterline, carrying it up into the blue storage container, rushing back to get another board, he doing the same, we working as a pair now…

Yep, I just wanted to help, but it’s also one of the best cover up for me at the moment. I see the Guardia Civil patrol car slowing down, and other police cars a bit further on. And as I was running to the beach opposite to anyone else around here, getting away from there…? Yep, what’s better than rushing up to go to help my friend.

But at once the police car has gone, about all the people already gone, all the boards being in the container, Miquel starting to lock it down, I say “I must go”.

He replies: “Yeah, thanks, see you”.

“Hardly” I think, sadly.

I see the rocks, and all the people from the rocks and the beach have gone, only me and Miquel left, he behind the blue container as he’s locking the doors, I slip into the large rain drainage tube. 

I’ve seen it before when being here and on the rocks. At once I peeped in just out of interest, now feeling thankful that it’s just right here because that’s what I need, a hideout.

I’ll have to hide until the dawn.

It’s odd… When being in the crowds, even as wearing the beaten up face I have now, slightly bruised but the blood washed up away from it, I can fit in. Much better than in a case I’ll go to the rocks on my own, being the only one there, as then the police or whoever would wonder about it and pick me up.

But it’s better to avoid crowds, my face and its bruises starting to get nastier coloring very soon. And that’s why I’ll have to avoid all the people in the near future.

I well understand that my face is way too much similar with those of the people’s mobile phone video clips which will be released soon. The people which were filming me will be asked and those exact videos will be seen everywhere, all over the news, all news, absolutely everywhere in this country, and about everywhere in this world.

That kind of a real reality action will be broadcasted all around the world, that’s for sure. And when that broad broadcasting starts, I’m better off somewhere else, far, far away from here.

Now squatting in the temporary hideout, hidden myself behind the blankets and the mattress which some scum has arranged here for his comfortable nest… Thinking…

Only for about six hours until I can move again and sneak into the hotel, under the cover of the night’s darkness. 

So, now I have time to think, or relax. 

The only bad thing in relaxing after the fights and wounds, as thinking of my badly beaten up body, is that when the relaxation after the action starts, then the recovery starts as well. And that’s exactly when all pains are hitting the hardest.

When in action, adrenaline filling the veins, with the mind focused only to that it has to, in complete ignorance of pain or any other distraction, then everything is kind of fine. But when the action stops and the recovery starts, then it all hits the hardest.

And that’s why I know that this six hours rest here now will be painful, especially then when starting to move on again. But as knowing the facts and being prepared to that, it helps, at least some.

And as thinking of the forthcoming events… 

I close my eyes and decide to rest and take it easy, actually ignoring the thoughts. It just is better like that for now…












CHAPTER 6


I wake up as having an electric shock, being fully awake in a second.

The pain is the first thing in my relaxation hitting my brains.

Next is the fact that it’s pitch dark, with the pain about everywhere in my body. 

Checking the time from my dear iPhone 5 SE, small but powerful, nicely compact at its size, it telling me 02.46.

Perfect timing. Time to go.

Easy to say, but… when trying to move my limbs the reality check happens. I’m in a terrible condition, absolutely terrible. My back is burning like a hell, the face is burning like a hot hell and the left side of my hip is burning like a lava-red hot hell.

But, another but… 
I must force myself on the move, just must.

One toe at the time, one finger at the time, one limb at the time, getting the body obeying my orders, now growling out from the hideout, being thankful of the accommodation and the blankets, getting out only about the ten meters way in the drainage tube, feeling it being one of the longest ever…

But I’m out, now straightening my back, forcing the thoughts back to the mission, ignoring the pain and wrecked body, starting to move, first slowly but then faster. Well trained total ignorance of the pain is taking the place now, transforming the brains functioning in a way that the pains are getting away, replacing the capacity with all focus on the tasks.

The lights of the town are giving me just about perfect sight that I can see the rocks barely enough. The water glimmering between the rocks, letting me see the actual rocks, and especially when my eyes start getting used to the darkness, kind of a cat sight taking the place, it’s all fine.

Also knowing that here on the shoreline, under the perfect cover of the darkness, it’s absolutely impossible anyone to see me from above, or from any of the buildings.

Step by step, from the rock to the rock, jumping and partly just running on the smooth rocky surface, following the water edge shoreline, I’m advancing now with a relatively nice pace. 

Heading off towards the hotel in which I have been staying, hoping to get into my room on the highest floor without anyone seeing me, still figuring it out how to manage to do it.

Now running steadily forward, reaching the path on the shoreline between the rocks which I’ve been running many times. 

Focusing fully with all possible concentration to stay on the rocks and the path, avoiding slipping and hurting myself, now thinking that I love these rocks… It’s so beautiful here.

It’s the first time being here at the nighttime, but as knowing the way, knowing the path, repeated it numerous of times, it’s actually surprisingly easy to go.

Now seeing the Masa hotel, the one I’m staying, very nice place indeed in the perfect spot on the cliffs, with stunning views, the best around here, in a relatively lonely and remote location, just as I like it...

I know I’ll have to skip greeting with the great staff, always helpful with very welcome friendliness and good service. It’s really a pity as I’ll have to go, as I like the place a lot. Been staying there many times, spent evenings enjoying the live music, dancing, having fun… Great, but it’s all gone now.

I must get my stuff from the hotel and then go. That’s the only plan I have at the moment.

Still trying to figure it out that what to do next and where to go? This very next act being almost the only thing on my mind at the moment, go to the hotel room and to get my stuff. Then I’ll figure it out, I think.

Realizing that I’m death tired, as the brains are playing the same play over and over again. “Go to the room, get the stuff, and go, go away from here.” 

Even when trying to form some kind of smart thinking of the options, considering the odds and adds, all the details in that and that, possible scenarios in different cases choosing the best, what is the police going to do next, how to keep hiding, who were the terrorists, what has happened where in the last six or seven hours…?

Well, as having a little hunch of all that I’m realizing that it’s best to leave it for now. Feeling totally exhausted, completely off, wrecked, smashingly tired… for sure it’s the best to leave it for now.

Now seeing the Masa hotel above, it’s shape about fifty meter above the sea surface, steep cliff in front of me, realizing how the way there is full of cactuses and other nasty greenery, swearing the fact that there is absolutely zero clear passage anywhere here…

HUH! The best what I can say is “fuck”.

Now trying to find the best spot to get up to the hotel… Realizing that there are absolutely only awful passages from here up to there…

Someone would have planned and built nice wooden staircase from the hotel down here, so I would use it now. How good and practical that idea seems to me now?

But as there is only the steep cliff, the rocks, cactuses, bushes, scratching sharp branches everywhere up there… I have only one option left, and it’s “just go”.

I see the spiral staircase in the corner of the hotel, up from the ground to the rooftop. That’s my way in, I know.

Now growling up towards the bushes, swearing on my mind, just growling the steep cliffy and rocky hill, I’m actually advancing. Now pushing through the bushes, avoiding the most beautiful, oldest and the biggest cactuses, straight forward dodging here and there…

Yep, I’m actually advancing.

Full of scratches, some starting to bleed, the skin getting more and more bloody decoration, the t-shirt being riddled and almost ripped off, the knees bleeding…

The last push through the last bush without a hesitation, focusing to the fact that it’s done now, and the next task is in front of me.

The iron spiral staircase. 
The grill door for entering is locked, and a kind of iron grills blocking the way into the actual staircase, all the way up, means that I have to climb outside the whole thing.

It’s only five stores up, being in this condition now, realizing that this is going to be one of a hell of a long climb now, I start climbing. Taking the tight grip from the grills, setting the feet one at the time, pulling me up, thanking that I have used to do free climbing just by bare hands equipping me… I start getting upper one floor at the time.

I see this climbing exercise being the only choice, as going in from the front door and saying “hi, I’m back” is surely out of my options now. In a case being exposed now there would be tens of police cars here, me being detained and tough questions asked. So, the best to do is to keep climbing.

Just when almost getting up to the roof, someone comes out to the balcony. A lonely man, looking at the pitch dark sea, having fresh air… me freezing still just holding without moving at all, taking one of a hell long cigarette pause.

Finally he goes back in and I can finish the job, sneaking onto the rooftop, going now above the room I’m staying. I look down and yep, there is a way in. Now taking a tight grip form the edge of the roof, reaching out, hanging down and swinging onto the balcony… At first one swing, then the other, one more to get more speed as having exactly two clear options, to fall down or onto the balcony, I’m swinging the third time choosing the latter. 

Being very, very tired, but managed to survive and make it this far, I’m feeling thankful. Having a deep sigh, being safe, thinking, finally here. Now bowing down, leaning with my hands against the knees as resting a little and having a fresh sea air. 

Then I’m looking into the room thought the window, a little night light on in the corner of the room. I see the door locked. But as it is, pure must to get in, slightly feeling sorry for the hotel, as I’m now breaking in and opening the door. 

One thing is a way too attractive, and I step a few steps towards it. I drop the backpack, fall down on my back, falling asleep on the way falling… and that’s the last thing I understand of anything… the bed.











CHAPTER 7


“I love these little action dreams”.

Still asleep, deeply asleep in the dream world, seeing a new little action dream, movie kind of clip, on the perfect dream screen…

I’m seeing the dream, realizing that it’s the dream, in a way analyzing it as being awake, but it is all just a dream, the action dream happening, including that analytic view looking at the dream. 

I love these 3D three levels dreams, one is the actual action, another is the one watching the dream, then the third one is my consciousness wondering that what are those two doing, and that is it just a dream or a reality.

He is walking on the beach, with his army pants and the gray-bluish, perhaps army type sleeveless t-shirt on.

He notices something odd at the beach, a bit further on, next to the dunes.

Four men standing, all wearing similar wetsuit kind of clothing, covering up their whole body including the neck and most of the head. 

Their suits are looking like diving gears, black full body wetsuits… and that’s odd. But the oddest thing is their posture, just standing, observing the surrounding, the beach, the people, somehow recording the situation and considering… something.

And, in addition to that oddness, they all have black bags on the ground, on the sand. Maybe they have their diving gears there, snorkels, flippers… whatever.

But their perfectly fitting and combined posture is somehow threatening. And even worse than all that, their coordinated standing, firmness and… Well, they are just standing still as soldiers in line.

He stops from walking, looks around, smiles at some kids playing, at the same time having a bit better look at those four men. He seems worried, there is a tensed look at his face, just for a moment but just noticeable.

He starts walking again, but now towards to the boardwalk which is leading towards the four men standing maybe about seventy meters away. But his walk is now slower than his normal fast advancing power walk style, long walks daily habit on the beach, barefoot, very effective, good exercise in the world’s best environment with the freshest air available, lovely refreshing sea air.

I’m watching the dream scene, seeing it as a movie, dream movie. Everything looks and feels so real, very, very real. The dream I’m seeing now is the best ever type of a dream quality. Full size with unlimited pixels…

He is now getting closer to the four men…

And then, suddenly, something happens, he scoots forward towards the four men, especially towards one.

The one is reaching down, taking something from his black bag, at the same time when the other three are rushing away from him. And as the four men are now suddenly reacting, for some reason, he is closing down towards the one which is his obvious target.

The dream has suddenly burst out into the full action, the best movie action, and everything happens in seconds.

The dream I’m watching… It’s very real, unbelievably real, and once again it’s difficult to distinguish that is it real or just a dream. I decide that it’s just a dream, so let it go on. I want to see the rest, what’s going to happen.

At the same time, three other men in suits are getting a bit further from the one, he is clearly approaching the one, and the one is now lifting up the machine gun, going to point it at him. And the one is going to shoot him.

A real serious full action has taken place, at the beach… on the beach full of the people. There are hundreds of the people, all over the long beautiful beach, enjoying the best ever holiday day in their lives. Hundreds of children, playing, happy playful voices, their parents looking at them, lots of people sunbathing, lots of people swimming…

The scene is the best ever beach scene, except the disturbing fact what I’m seeing happening now. And as seeing the machine guns, four men against one, apparent terrorist attack going to take the place on the beach... That’s the most horrible thing to imagine.

Just at the very same moment, he reaches the one which is going to shoot at him, kill him, he jumps the last long leap and clashes against the one with the gun.

Miraculously, he manages to avoid the bullets of the bursting gun, and in about two seconds he has snapped the neck of the one terrorist.

At the same time the full scale panic starts at the beach. But at first the people freeze, and as the three other terrorists start shooting at him with three simultaneously firing machine guns, pap-pap-pap-pap…

Luckily, it’s just a dream, so let’s see the rest I think, being sure it’s just a dream.

He is now laying on the ground behind the one whose neck he snapped, and those three are firing at him with endless burst of the bullets. The bullets are nudging against the dead man’s body, possibly some hitting him too. And the whole situation looks bad, very bad for him, as his chances to survive are zero.

Then he shoots once, middle of the forehead of one terrorist, the man’s head in a black suit swinging backwards by the force of the bullet. 
Then he shoots another time, only about a second after the first, and his bullet hits the forehead of the other terrorist, which is repeating exactly the same pattern than the first, starting to fall down backwards.

And only about one second more, the third man is following his pals, ending up having a bullet in the head, falling down backwards, all of their three machine guns still bursting the spree of the bullets out…

There is a full panic now at the beach, a chaos, full scale chaos. Hundreds of the people, all at the same time, terrible screaming, all the people suddenly on the move, but all of them rushing into the different directions, children, parents, everybody… 

It’s a nightmare, worst ever nightmare! 

He is still lying down on the beach sand, now looking around, one dead body in front of him, three other dead terrorist smashed on their backs lying down in the neat line… all equally dead.

He’s looking around…

And that’s when I wake up.

I shake my head, I have to. It was so unbelievably real, so amazingly real. I love these action dreams, dream dreams, but this one was so confusingly real. 

What a nightmare actually?!
But luckily it’s just a dream. 
WOW!

Still being confused, lying on my back on the bed, in the hotel room, the very same I used to stay often… Must say that it was confusingly real that dream. And must say that I hope it stays as a dream, even though similar terrible terrorist events are happening in the real life too, and even worse than that.

Must say that the world is such a horrible place I think. Still being confused as the dream was so unbelievably real. But now opening my eyes, going to move, get the day started with a long walk on the beach, maybe having a run on the rocks, which I used to do and which I love too, the walks and the runs.

Now lifting my head up as going to turn on my side to get up from the bed…

A hell of a hell-full pain hits my hip and face, stinging into my brains as an inch thick iron stick. The pain hits me so hard that I’m almost going to faint, end up back to the dream world. It hits so massively hard that I would roar, just out of pure striking pain.

I’m smirking my face, touching the hip with my hand, closing my eyes, squeezing them tight close, grimace of the pain on my face…

And then the reality hits me even harder than the pain, and I say out loud the best conclusion I can, after all this confusing experienced in this morning.

“Fuck!”

In that very particular moment I realize that “it all has happened, I’ve been shot at”.

And then the reality comes back into my mind flooding as a flash flood, but a flood of the memories, very near past memories, from as close as yesterday.

I realize that it all happened yesterday. I remember now, every second, every moment, every move… I remember it all, exactly like it was in the reality… 

And I feel all that terrible pain!

I realize, fully, it’s too bad to be real, but it’s all real, too real. And as having this blood freezing sudden reality check…

“Fuck!” What else I can say?

Feeling the pain, I lift my upper body. I grab the TV remote and I click the TV open.

It’s needless to race the channels. It’s all over the TV broadcasting, obviously all over the news as well, the whole thing.

I’m staring at the screen, nice big screen. I see the news anchor explaining the terrorist attack with excitement on her face. Beautiful news anchor seems to be upset, actually very upset, when explaining the horrible news of that what has happened.

Suddenly, the clips of the people’s mobile phones, one after another, multiple mobile phone films, all filming the same thing…
Bloody, bloody fight in the white van.

Yep, the reality check checks straight into my brains now. I see myself. 

“Mierda” I’m fucking seeing myself on the big TV screen. I’m on the news, the main character in the real life action movie, filmed by many private mobile producers, bystanders, by their phones. 

And it’s me there, ended up fighting with the four terrorists, at first knocking out the one, then the second in the most brutal way, only a moment later after a short struggle shooting another, then fighting with the third one.

I see the whole thing now, by the TV screen, filmed by the shaky hands, with the mobile phone. But all in the HD quality, high standards, very real, and being kind of a good quality reality type of filming.

I see the fight and the impossible position which I was. And I see myself dying. Then suddenly, reviving, sticking the knife into the terrorist’s throat, the blood bursting out. Now thinking that how can they even show it in the news, as by my opinion it’s too real and too bloody to be on the TV.

Then I can follow how the action hero, the guy, me! He’s looking around, with somehow cold blooded posture, grabbing the gun from the ground, taking the backpack from the van putting the stuff into it, the gun and the knife… and looking around again.

Then I can hear as the people start cheering, loud cheering. Then a little bit confused look at the action hero’s bloody facemask, it looking like someone has smashed a dozen of bloody meatballs on his face. Then some kind of grim which would be a smile, and then I see this idiot bowing to the audience.

And I see him lifting his hand, obviously showing the sigh to the people to stay away from him. And the last thing I see is when he runs away, limping with clear difficulties, holding his hip with his hand, the black backpack on his shoulder.

The next the news cut back to the news anchor, she explaining how the people call the man, the one who saved the day and successfully managed to foil the terrorist attack, the hero who killed stunningly eight terrorists in total, “The Matador”, the bullfighter. They also call him “Matarife”, the butcher. 

It’s too much for me!
I have to shut down the TV. 
And I know I have to think, think, and think.
























CHAPTER 8


After a long, long consideration of a few seconds, I decide to grab my stuff and go.

I figure it out without any problems that there will be the police searching the hotel soon. There must be a massive operation ongoing in this town now. Hundreds of polices from all security branches all here, or heading to come here. There must be a full scale operational center nearby, all deploying the procedures they have been trained to deploy.

And what are my chances in this game?

Go and turn myself in, endless interrogations, months of detainment, more and more questions, all which must be unanswered.

How would I explain myself?

“I just tempted to be there and then I snapped his neck and shot three of them under the worst ever imaginable battleground situation, cold bloodedly with one shot each of them.”

“Well, I was just lucky to hit the forehead, with the most perfect snapshot.”

“Then I just thought that there might be more of them and then I found them and managed to kill them all with bare hands.”

Yep, my explanations and assurances that it was all just about coincidence and good luck, would be well heard, but totally ignored.

As being unable to end up into that situation, even though it’s me who saved the day and foiled the terrorist attack, there is only one option left for me, and that’s to go, vanish.

So, I look out and it’s still dark, or rather early morning. I know that everybody is sleeping as the early morning is the most peaceful time of the full 24 hours circle. And that being the fact it means that this is the best ever time me to go, make a next move.

Grabbing some of my stuff, only the black backpack which I got from the van, the gun and knife in it, adding a bunch of blue and white freezer cool pads which I have with me wherever I go. Putting the black leather purse with the personal belongings on my hip, clicking the lock and tightening the belt, even though it hurts as a hell… I’m ready to go.

Knowing that I have to leave all the rest of my stuff, as on a run I’ll only need the least, I’m going to the balcony with the intention to escape the same way I got in.

Standing on the railing, reaching up, I manage to get into the roof. All the way down along the iron circle staircase, without any problems or delays at this time. Climbing down the steep rocky cliff, almost vertical hill, I get back on to the rocks.

Now heading off towards the actual Torrevieja, jumping from the rock to the rock, half-running, half-climbing as the path forward is cliffy rocks along the sea shoreline. The waves are clashing towards the rock, higher than normally I notice, wetting my clothes.

I’m continuing towards the one abandoned building I know very close by, the one I have now chosen to stay for a little while, being able to think, finally.

It’s an old hotel called Eden Roc. It’s been empty for over a decade for some reason, but now it’s going to get a visitor, now famous visitor, a lonely rider called “The Matador”. 

How matching I think, “La Mata Matador”…

I would laugh at my thoughts if I could but this is all too serious to do that. That’s why I just make a deep sigh when getting on towards to the building. I can see it already, all the way up on the cliff, just about half a kilometer away from the Masa hotel.

At this time there are the steep narrow old concrete stairs, the ones I have used to climb numerous of times, sometime even running them up and down. Somehow I always liked this photogenic spot, rocky shoreline, high cliffs, abandoned surrounding, quiet, peaceful, equipped with the strong sound of the sea waves reaching the rocks and splashing above. 

I must say that always liked it, this particular hidden spot which very rare people know even existing. Sometimes some fishermen, mostly only the big black ants lining up, up and down, on their hard working hours… And as being so I’m pleased about it just right now.

Now taking the first step, to run up along the steep concrete stairs, looking around as going, only a few meters and reaching the first platform, then the running up the rest, finally on the narrow steep hilly road.

There are numerous of buildings here, kind of fitted in on the cliffs, a little neighborhood, which only a few know existing. It’s impossible to see this place from above, from the road where thousands of cars and the people are passing by every day. 

It’s one of the busiest roads between La Mata beach and Torrevieja center, the one I have gone by thousands of times myself. The road I like a lot, it leading to La Mata, or to the other direction to the rocks, Los Locos beach, all the way to the Torrevieja’s center and the seashore roads.

The way, all the way ten or fifteen kilometers depending of the route, I have done numerous of times. I love the combination of the seashore here, it being one of the most variable in the world. And I can tell it, as I have seen them a lot, hundreds or even thousands of different beaches and seashores and coastal towns, all over the world. 

Now walking upwards the hilly narrow road, towards to the abandoned Eden Roc hotel…

My plan is simple, very simple, to get in and then think. I’ll also need something to eat in some point, that’s for sure. As thinking of it, the last time I remember eaten anything at all was… Wait!

It was exactly about 24 hours ago, early in the morning, for the breakfast, one banana.

I used to eat an “English breakfast”, a heavy stupid greasy unhealthy piece of garbage long, long time ago, over 30 years ago, somewhere in this world when travelling, and doing things…

But nowadays, fitted with the brains, the last thirty years I have eaten light breakfast if anything at all. It was already back then when I started to understand something about that “English idiotism” stupidity such as the heaviest and unhealthiest breakfast in the world.

Now trying the locked door, but it feeling like jammed. Realizing that it’s better to leave it just like that as there will be the police around here as well, that’s for sure too.

I decide to have a little climbing excursion again. Now looking at the side of the abandoned building, and especially the balconies, figuring out the way up, and finally inside…

Yep, as simple as it is, I have to climb up along the balconies. I used to do that, up and down, easily. I used to jump down, free fall from the third store, hitting the ground and rolling around, ending up on the feet. Paratroopers know it, some specialist as well, and they can jump down from amazingly high, landing without hurting themselves at all. It’s called training.

Now already getting upwards, the first floor, the second, this climbing up along the buildings seemingly being my restarted hobby... The hobby I thought I’ll have left to the past, completely. But finally, reaching the third floor, I see a broken window, and I decide to get in through that.

Somebody has been taken care of this building as all the doors and windows are well locked up and covered with the plywood boards. But up here it seems to be loser standards as actually, I can see now several windows broken. And the one I saw first I’m just right now entering. Removing some glass pieces first and then climbing in.

And “Here I am” thinking…
 
“Oh, gosh! That was a thing.” It comes out from my mouth without even realizing it. 
Who am I talking to, myself?

As thinking of it, when the question has been asked, I also realize that that’s the only one I’ll be talking to, for some time from now on. And as realizing that, the reality check hits me again. It smashes my face. By the very short relaxed moment which I was just a moment ago pleasantly having, brings up the reality that it’s going to be a long, long lonely way ahead for me now. 

Or do I have any other options?
What can I do? Should I turn myself in?

As thinking of that option, maybe one of the most important questions appear on my mind… Who are the terrorists?

And just right after that I remember the words… or actually only one but very significant word “Go”.

The man in the van, the one I killed second, said it to the driver. But what’s so remarkable in that was that it was said in such a situation. He said it as a command, calmly, but in the most action filled moment, just about when he was going to be killed. 

And as being so, it most likely means that he used his native language, the first what comes into your mind at the most serious moment in your life… It’s your native language you use. And if that’s the case, how could the terrorist use English, in pure English accent?

Where about in this world they are using English, natively?

Now as thinking of their posture, looking like well trained and coordinated group... Are the terrorist that well trained? But on the other hand they were relatively quick to eliminate, even though I tempted to dye once myself too. It means that either my reactions happened to be overwhelmingly superior as compared to theirs, or they were just a bunch of ideologists on the suicide action.

But, more buts, they had an escape plans, well deployed, with additional plans. Those guys were exploiting totally other type of a mission than being on a suicide mission. And that rings the other bells again.

Now hearing too many bells ringing, mixing with the police sirens somewhere out on the street, practically all the same time, I remember the phone. The phone which he was using for filming the massacre, the very same which I followed, and found, and picked up from the street… “I must check the phone.” I say.

Opening the black backpack’s zipper, hoping that the phone is still there… Now looking for it, finding, grabbing it onto my hand, taking out from the backpack… I push the main button to wake the phone up.

It’s on, “Great!” I say.

But it’s locked.

I look at the phone. It’s apparently Chinese manufactured, some unrecognizable brand, obviously bough from the roadside store, apparently having a prepaid card, all unregistered, impossible to track. 

So, how to get it open? How to call to the last number? How to see the video as it would show the terrorists as well? 

“Tricky stuff these phones nowadays” I think. At the same time realizing that I just have to leave it for now.

“So, what to do next?” I ask from myself. 

Then suddenly feeling hunger…

“Where to get food, something to eat”, the next full sentence finds its way out from my mouth. But, as the fact is that all the food cooked in this hotel has rotten over a decade ago, the next most important thing occurs on my mind. What’s going on?

I stand up and decide to go to the rooftop to scope the surrounding. I can see the whole town from the rooftop, the roads, now wanting to that is there anyone around here.

Now starting to walk forward along the narrow corridor heading off towards to the staircase, or at least where I think it would be. Finding the staircase, going up, opening the door of the rooftop, feeling the fresh air again, after the musty air inside…

The first and the most recognizable thing are the police sirens, as they seem to be about everywhere in the town.

I look at the Torrevieja, nice little town, average but nice. I look at the sea, loving the view from up here, maybe one of the best in the town. Especially, and what’s the best in this town are the beaches and the whole shoreline within twenty kilometer radius. There is about everything anyone needs for the pleasant beach and the seafront life.

Now sitting down, thinking, that what a heck I’m going to do next?














CHAPTER 9


I think I fell asleep.

It’s getting hot, the sun is burning and it’s getting hot here on the rooftop.

I must go in.

When I’m trying to move my limbs, almost the only thing what happens is a breath-taking pain paralyzing my body and brains…

And as realizing that, as feeling the stabbing pain all over my body, striking on my mind, I’m feeling so tired, so unbelievably tired…

I would sleep more, much more, but… must keep going. Staying still and collapsing into some kind of coma of tiredness… that’s the last thing I can do now. So, the only choice is to keep going, just keep going.

Now forcing the pain off by ignoring it, but still realizing crystal clear the fact that the condition I’ve got myself into, is seriously, very seriously bad.

I have been shot at, luckily only once, but the wound is serious. As feeling thankful for the fact that the bullet went straight through my body, mid body, hip on the left side… Yep, that truly is one of the greatest facts here to enjoy off…

Now laughing at my own thoughts and joy of tiredness, realizing the reality and its severity, I’m doing the exact thing what’s the best in this dire situation…

Focus. Must focus! 
It’s a full scale survival mission now.

And what to do to survive, that’s the best question to answer about. At the moment, regarding to all horrible things, all that what has happened, the very exact moment in the very exact present… It’s about survival now.

One thing, very important thing… 
I must take care of myself.

As realizing that I’m running only depending on the most extreme elements of the human body and mind, adrenaline, determination, excess powers, self-manipulation and stimulation… all those on the other side of the normality, on the side which takes serious toll from the balance of the body.

The balance is about everything, and when exceeding your powers you’ll have to have time and place to rest and recover too. When exceeding your powers you must get the body and mind recharged, properly, or you’ll run out of the whole thing, practically burning off your abilities to do anything at all.

But in this moment, in this dire situation, the only option is to keep going, survive, to get away from here. There will be time to rest and recover, but it’s all later on, somewhere in the future, the nearer the better I think. The sooner the better…

Now standing up, very, very slowly, with big difficulties, I manage to do it. The next thing is to go in, have cover from the burning hot sunshine. And I’ll have to find something to eat, and drink. Drinking is the most important thing at the moment. 

You can survive without eating, for a week when it’s must, but without drinking it’s barely possible to survive even for a couple of days. So, I think, one task at the time. The next one is finding something to drink, whatever, but the best is just water.

The stairs down are hard task for me now. I really have to concentrate to be able to walk them down, one step at the time. And I have to go all the way down, leaning to the railings, supporting myself, limping… taking one step at the time, preventing from falling.

On the way down I see some old dusty bag, big sports bag. It looks like someone has dropped it in a hurry, left it behind. I think I know what it is, and I look at it closer. 

Opening the zipper… Yep, that’s it!

I love kite surfing, I absolutely love it.

It’s the kite surfing kite, and it seems to be okay. It’s old, looking like a bit ragged, worn out, old, but otherwise it looks okay. Only the board is missing and it would be used I think, now missing the sports activity which I love, great sports and joy, gliding and flying above the sea surface, jumping over the waves, high-speed, other surfers around doing the same… 

Just great, one of the greatest!

When standing up again I see the board too, and for some odd reason it fills me with a little joy, thinking a bit ridiculously… Finding a full kite surfing package in the abandoned hotel and being happy about it, in the situation in which it’s completely useless. 

Especially so in the situation I have run into at the moment, as it’s all about survival instead of joy, sports, activities, great fun. In the situation the hardcore fact is that there are only hard and harsh options to be seen in my near future expectations now.

Now continuing downwards of the stairs, all the way to the ground floor, trying to find the kitchen and utility rooms, as there I would find something useful… Some supplies such as water, anything to eat, clean rags to take care of and fix myself a little, maybe even medicines and antiseptics.

Yep, the pure fact is that I have ignored the wounds completely, even the bullet wound. I have been playing highly risky games with it, but I had to.

Leaving the wound on its own luck, just forcing the thought to be thankful to be alive, as the wound would have killed you already anytime in the near past… 

Well, that’s a kind of the hardest choice you may have to do in the situation like have happened. But now I have a luxury to have little while of time to give some attention to that and to do my best for the wound and its healing. It’s must I know.

Finally finding the kitchen and there is the storage room as well. Looking around in the dim light which is filtering through the plywood boards covering up all of the windows and doorways.

I see a pile of sheets, some little kitchen towels, some cleaning stuff… All old and fully covered up with thick layer of grayish-reddish dust… But even though all looks bad and dirty, anyway, they have been clean when folded and piled up, so they are still clean inside, which is perfect for me for now.

Now taking a few and putting them into my backpack, heading off to the kitchen, hoping to find water or even food…

And when entering to the kitchen, and looking into a little storage room, I sigh, deeply sigh.

I see small water bottles fallen onto the floor, dropped maybe when someone have been emptying the place and storages. I see cans, food cans too, and that’s definitely the greatest news I can have at the moment. Being grateful to that whoever has been doing poor job in cleaning and emptying the storage, leaving good and useful stuff behind. 

Very, very good and useful for me now!

Maybe it has been worthless to them back then, but for me it’s the best and the most valuable stuff I can have at the moment. Now putting different type of cans into my backpack, vegetables, paella, meatballs… Meatballs! I have to take a few more, about fifteen cans in total, ten small water bottles…

And suddenly, when having this lucky strike again, practically, I collapse and slide down, back against the wall, on to the floor.

Feeling so terrible tired. Massively! 

Honestly, it’s almost impossible to bear. Crushing tiredness, bullet hole in the mid body, face smashed, scratches and bruises everywhere… 

Being physically and mentally wrecked…

So, in a situation like this, a little pleasure in a form of meatballs… it’s maybe the best thing to have, and that’s why I take one meatball can, the knife and I open one with the knife simply by hitting it through the lid. 

Now using the knife, eating, one meatball at the time, zipping water in between, I’m enjoying the most satisfying lunch I have ever had. At least it feels the best. Maybe fifteen years old meatballs with as old water, tasting as good as anything can be.

When somebody is as greedy to the food, good tasty and fatty food, grilled beefs, big beefs, all meaty stuff… having meatballs in the situation I am, last eaten a couple of days ago, just great must say.

Enjoying of each ball ending up to my mouth, sauce in the can, water… Great!

I’m opening another can, the second water bottle, and emptying both at the same pace than the first round. Just taking my time, filling up the stomach, slowly, with a great satisfaction, finally, having food…

Food and water are the most important ingredients in the recovery. And rest of course. And as being so, I’m giving plenty of time to this now, just sitting down, eating slowly, legs straightened on the floor, drinking, stocking up my inner storage, having energy there, feeling how it starts warming me up, spreading all over the body… Satisfaction!

It takes me about two hours to finish the relaxing lunch, very much needed pause. The next thing I’ll do is to clean up especially the bullet wound, but also others, all of them.

Now watering one kitchen towel with the bottled water, touching at first carefully the wound on the front side, wiping it clean, then the same on the back side… 

As doing so, feeling thankful, very much thankful, that I had such a big luck with me, really… Only a few centimeters, an inch and I would be gone, dead already now.

Well, maybe in a case it was any worse I would have collapsed at the place there, and the medics would have collected and transported me into the hospital. As thinking of the chance to be in a bed, in the hospital, with the best care possible… Yep, that really feels tempting now.

But, then I would have been detained and it’s purely impossible to afford to have that luxury. The best for all is to find a way out from here, out of the town, go underground, disappear… and then let the heat cool down.

But, as thinking of the bed in the hospital, having a “hotel room” with full service just for me, being well fed, well cleaned up, well taken care of… I decide to find a bed.

I know, it is a risky business to stay here as the police, and all forces, are looking for me all over the place, the town. They have to have a massive operation ongoing at the moment. And obviously, they are also looking for the terrorists, their connections, possible other terrorist cells.

All boots on the ground, that’s for sure. And as being so, the best is to stay away from the traffic. As realizing the fact that my face must be yellowish-bluish-brownish, and completely bruised… Yep, it’s better to stay away from the people.

Now standing up again, inspired with the sight of the comfortable bed on my mind, hissing myself into the second floor, into the first room I find, luckily discovering the bed in there…

Falling down on my back, on to the bed, once again, falling asleep already when falling…


















CHAPTER 10


It’s dark, pitch dark.

Some sound wakes me up. Something odd…

I realize that someone is trying to get in, squeaky sound. A little crack can be heard, somewhere in the downstairs. 

Crushing glass, broken pieces on the floor, under the boots, I’m recognizing the sound. Almost silent, but only almost, someone is sneaking in. 

Being now fully awake, alerted by the silenced sounds, alarmed. Adrenaline is flooding into my veins, filling up the muscles, mind hardening, thoughts letting space to the reaction, lips tightening, ears focused on listening… Something is up, that’s for sure.

I stand up from the bed and grab the backpack. It’s now feeling very heavy as it’s full of supplies, but I put it on my back. Ready to respond to any threat, sneaking into the corridor, nest to the staircase, then heading up to the upper floors.

More silenced sounds from the downstairs, someone is there that’s for sure.

Hearing parallel, barely noticeable sounds, glass cracking, rusty door hinges whining when slowly forced opening…

One thing I realize, in a case it’s the police they would just come and alert themselves, instead of sneaking in. They would make it with big maneuver, flashing lights all over the place outside the building, surrounding the premises, with tens of cars and men.

Another thing I realize is that someone is definitely sneaking in, middle of the night. If it was a group of kids they would make lots of noise. If it was a scum trying to find a place to stay, he would come at the daytime. 

So, what’s left, who would anyone come at the nighttime, sneaking in?

As thinking of it, the only option occurring on my mind, it’s the terrorists… 

But think of it, I think. 
What a hell would they do here? 
How would they know I’m being here?
Would the terrorist bother to start hunting me down instead of escaping themselves?

The whole town, the region, Spain entirely is in the highest alert at the moment, must be.
Why on earth would the terrorists risk everything and come after me?

At the same time when pondering, touching the walls and thus having the way up as advancing in the staircase, I can hear them coming. Only maybe one floor between us…

Special force, Spanish special force…

How about Spanish special force?

Possibly, that’s the only other choice. They, maybe, would try to sneak in, but how would they know that I’m hiding here.

Yep, whoever it is must know that I’m here.

Why would they sneak in middle of the night as the best time to do it is a broad daylight? How it would make sense to anyone to do it middle of the night? 

They would need night scopes, special equipment, with proper preparation. There would be bigger risks to deploy the arrest middle of the night in a full darkness.

The only option left are the terrorists…

But why would they risk everything to come after me? It’s the stupidest thing to do.

The phone! I realize it’s the phone.

That’s how they know where I am. They have tracking on it and they can see the location. They have had two days time to track me and prepare to come after me. 

But why on earth they would do it? That’s completely senseless act. And the only comprehensible fact is that it’s out of the question that real terrorists would do that anyway.

Weird, very weird, seriously weird…

One fact more is that they know my abilities. I managed to kill eight of them, all of them being armed. So, in a case it’s the terrorists, they must come with force, with the guns, with the special trained men…

Okay, in this point my consideration starts getting odd, truly odd. All odds are too odd.

I’m just reaching the highest floor when my foot hits something. I know instantly what it is, ignoring it, but at the very same moment the hell breaks out…

Stun grenades, deployed to my direction, loud explosions on the narrow corridor and in a closed space, it blocking my ears making me practically deaf…

“Fucking phone” I say out loud. 
They know precisely where I am. 
What a fool is carrying the phone of the enemy these days, as they are all traceable?

Yep, it’s me.

At first, the first reaction is to cover up my ears, even though in vain. The next is to take the handgun from the bag into my right hand, then dropping the backpack, jumping forward, towards the two men, barely distinguishable figures behind the thick smoke of the stun grenades deployed, shots fired… 

One long leap forward head first, then rolling around clean summerset, ending up on my feet, straight forward against the first man, grapping him with me.

I’m offering him one shot to the neck, slightly upwards, blowing up his brains. Another guy gets one bullet middle of his night vision goggles, and straight away two bullets more, onto his chest.

Yep, my bad habit to do it opposite than anyone else, one up and two down. And I do it in that way, always. The first is a kill shot, targeting literally middle of the eyes, and the two to the chest “just in case”. Even now, and especially now, regarding to the fact that everybody nowadays is wearing the body armor, but the face, it’s rarely protected.

More gunfire, hitting just above my head, coming from the staircase, from down upwards, so practically, I’m lying down on the ground, on the floor in a protected angle. 

They’ll have to come up to reach me, and that’s exactly what they are doing. Busting constant firing to force me down, keep me down, to cover up their advance.

But, I have a tool which these two scouts, now dead, brought for me. Grenades, bunch of grenades, real ones. When I grabbed the man down I noticed that he was carrying a row of grenades on his hip belt. And these beautiful little destroyers I’m throwing down to the staircase just right now.

Luckily I’m the first one doing that, as they would have done the same. But maybe they wanted to avoid risking their pals in a case either of them is still alive, or whatever reason, they let me a privilege to  do it first.

Seriously loud explosions, two of them about the same time, down at the staircase, stops firing bursts from there. 

Just to be sure I throw two more, which causes massive explosion. The floor underneath me feels like jumping up, as the airwave hits it from the underneath. I can hear collapsing crushing sounds when the concrete of the staircase is giving up. 

That sends me rushing up and straight up towards to the rooftop. On the way I grab my backpack, put it on my back and tighten the belts. The next I grab is the kite surfing bag, and then the board from the floor a bit further on, now running towards to the stairs up.

I run as fast as I can, throw one more grenade down behind me, the last one, causing one more explosion somewhere down there. I bang the rooftop door closed, and start opening the surfing bag. 

Now taking out the kite from the bag, spreading it on the roof, as fast as I can, now running back to take the harness from the bag, next, wearing it on, as fast as I can, tightening the belts of the harness, trying to check what I can check, but all in a big rush.

Last check, I think it’s all okay, ready to go.

The most dauntless, dare-devil in charge of my actions, foolhardy… I run towards the worst and the most dangerous stunt ever done. There is only about fifteen meters length in total on the rooftop… to get the air blowing enough and lifting the kite. 

Five meters more, over the roof edge, barely anything enough, hardly successfully, all likelihoods against me, all odds in a favor of complete failure, long, long dive down falling straight down towards a sure death, smashing to the rocks, all done, instantly killed.

Loud explosions behind me, the attackers deploying the grenades to the rooftop, full scale military type of action, their idea being to bomb me into the minced pieces. 

But, against all the odds, I manage to get some air under the kite, jumping over the edge, feeling like the kite pulling me up, but in a reality still falling… but instead of a free fall the air under the kite actually lifting it up. Knowing that pretty much sure death following, I have only one hope on my mind…

The idea of getting a bit further from the rocks on the shoreline, the kite slowing down my free fall, just about enough to let me smash into the water, to the sea, somehow being still alive...

That was my idea when jumping down from the roof. And now, when actually managing to fly the kite a little, still falling down quite fast, faster and faster…

At the same time hearing a gun fire, bullets whistling close by, me still falling, kind of controllably flying, kind of uncontrollably free falling...

I think I’m going to make it. Unbelievable!

Stunning burst of adrenaline overtakes my abilities of reasonable thinking, and out of the pure craziness I start laughing, just laughing on the way down. Adrenaline burst and the strongest hormone dopes in the world, flushing my brains on my mind, causing unavoidable reaction…

I’m laughing out loud, as loud as can, crazy laugh, when fast falling down towards to the sea surface.

It’s amazing, happened many times before, when the action is at its utmost, some kind of an overdosing of adrenaline, makes me laugh, crazy laugh out loud.

Just about going to smash to the sea surface, now strain on my legs and the whole body, preparing to take the hit, massive hit… I close my mouth, tightly, put the arms against the body, smash to the water, breaking the tension of the surface…

Straight through, into the deepness, five meters down, now starting to get back up, to have air, gasp of fresh air.

Feeling massive joy of success, under the influence of adrenaline overdosing, trying to get back to the surface… But, something is pulling me down.

When realizing the effect, also realizing the consequences, possibly sinking to the sea bottom by the weight of the backpack, my dear but dearly heavy load of survival supplies in it, mostly meatballs…

I start releasing the harness at first. As fast as I can I open the belt locks. Then as fast as I can I’ll start getting the backpack off. In a big hurry, now pulling the belts, trying to unlock them, sinking down, barely any air left, in a complete pitch black darkness… I’m sinking down towards to the sea bottom.

And it’s stuck! 
The whole set of multiple straps and locks…
All stuck, mixed, a mess!

Unable to open pretty much anything at all, still going down, there is the only common sensible word which comes into my mind, bursting out from my mouth, underwater, inevitably.

“Fuck!”






















CHAPTER 11


It’s pitch black here, complete darkness…

Too many straps and locks, all too badly messed up, me trying to unlock and untied, in a hurry, almost panicky.

Sinking, while sinking down, towards the sea bottom, I tell myself “Calm Down you fool!”

Even though I’m already deep, maybe eight or nine meters deep, still going down, it’s a must to calm myself down. Have a moment, stop doing whatever I’m doing, just calm down…

And think.

Quickly, I recollect the order of the straps and locks when I put them on. Even though it really is pitch black and complete darkness here, underwater, the sea being just blackness… I have a light on my mind, the recollection of the mental image of the straps and locks.

I see now, much better now. I see it on my mind, with the light of the imaginary, eyes tightly closed, but I see it now… That’s a trick which I use, simulation on the mind, to unlock the straps.

And I start unlocking them, one by one, eyes closed as it is pitch black down here underwater anyway. The sea is one of a huge blackness at the moment. I’m deep enough that any lights in the town, or anywhere, are unable to reach here, maybe ten meters deep.

Being calm now, even though knowing that I’m the most likely going to run out of oxygen anyway, now unlocking the straps one by one by very fast slow-motion moves… Unlocking and releasing myself as fast as I can, with deliberate, quickly premeditated act.

And, finally, I’m getting them of, at first the kite surfing harness, and then the backpack. 
I’m actually getting them off, I think!

I know I’m in a big deep trouble now, maybe eleven meters deep. I have been here well over a minute already, maybe two, holding my breath, and I still need time to get up. And In addition to that I have an extra task, I realize.

Only option to get back onto the surface from here is to release some weight from the backpack. It’s way too heavy that I can get up with it, especially when I’m in a big hurry now. 

But, instead of just letting the backpack go… I definitely want to have the gun and the knife, and my freezer cooling pads…

So, being unable to see anything at all, using the mental vision, opening the zipper, now groping the food cans and the water bottles out from the backpack, I manage to remove most of the weight. 

Still going down, apparently, in a complete darkness, underwater, sinking, presumably drowning… calmly, I put the backpack back into my back. Knowing that I definitely need my both hands to get up from here…

If there is any chance that I can get up!

I know it. Alarms are banging the bells, red lights blinking bright, all odds betting against me, the facts in favor of drowning. And I know that the one lungs-full I took before plunging into the water, the last breath I got just in a moment when smashing into the sea surface, one last gasp of breath… the most likely was the last I ever got.

But, I have another idea, and that’s to get back to the surface. I start getting bored in dying, almost in daily basis, and that’s the motivational thought I use to save myself. Thinking that I have lots of things to do, many, many nice things… and that I’m getting bored in dying… “I must get up!”

Now starting to pull up, strongly pulling by hands and kicking with legs…

But, suddenly, realizing one hardcore discovery, asking the most ever important question in my life at the moment, for the rest of my life if any, that “where the hell is the surface?”

One of the weirdest things which can happen in night diving, when diving, being underwater in a complete darkness, hits my consciousness, and it hits hard.

You can lose the sense of directions, up or down, upside or downside. And that shitty experience happens now. I’m absolutely unaware that where I should go. When starting to go, where to go? I definitely want to go up that’s for sure, but where the hell is up?

My body weight is pulling me down, obviously, but as being unable to feel anything, stream or anything, except the massive water pressure squeezing me… when unable to see anything, except the pitch blackness, when unable to sensor the direction…

There is only one choice to make, and it’s to pick one, take the direction, whatever it is, and go. And that’s it, all what you got, you’ll lose or win. Wherever you choose to go, it being right or wrong, but that’s the last chance in your life now.

That’s the reality I have hit now.

As the fact is that I’ve used all oxygen, been underwater for a few minutes, maybe two, or three, or more, it’s difficult to say. As the fact is that I’ve already run out of the oxygen, and that in a reality I’ve run out of the time too, only some excess limits being left, going to be death within a…

Do I have fifteen seconds, half a minute, one minute more? Who knows?

The fact is that I have what I have, that’s all. The time what’s left is in the hands of luck, good or bad. The only way I know, is the moment my brains run out of oxygen, I faint. And in a case that factor happens, I’m dead, real death taking the lead at this time, my body starting to sink further down.

I pick up the direction, hoping that it’s the right one, going up, the right way back onto the surface. On my mind, I saw the light, the light of hope, imaginary light somewhere up there, it being up for me now.

I start following the light, eyes closed, in the complete darkness, unable to see anything at all, just the imaginary light of my mind being my beacon, the light of hope.

There is only one chance left, only one try, and it’s this now. If I took the wrong direction, that’s it. There was only one try, you used it, you are gone, death followed. But I have faith, feeling confident, pulling myself upwards, with the hope that it’s being going up, truly upwards. But to be honest, it’s all on the hands of the luck now, and it’s definite.

But then, suddenly, I feel it, somehow lighter, thinking that’s it is feeling lighter. The pressure, it’s the pressure… The pressure is feeling lighter, less pressure.

I’m sure about it, hope that it’s about that…

I know from my previous experiences that it can feel “much lighter and much brighter”, just about before you’ll lose the consciousness. Bliss filling your emotions, the mind protecting itself, just about in a moment you are gone. Your very last emotion being the bliss, lucky bliss to have…

But I open my eyes, I want to see the light, a real light, and in a moment I do so, I’ll plunge through the water surface… And I see the lights, the lights of the town.

Now gasping the air, lots of air, but instincts preventing me from gasping too much, as that can be dangerous too. I see the lights and I’m lucky to be alive. Being saved once again, now thinking that how many lives I have used and how many I still have left.

But being lucky to be alive! Truly a great moment after a serious life danger…

At the same time when realizing the very narrow survival once again, now looking at the direction of the town, and the abandoned Eden Roc hotel I came from. Still seeing the fire on the rooftop, flashing lights, starting to hear the sirens of the police cars…

Yep, realizing that it’s far from over, and also realizing that it’s “must go” again. 

But where to go? 
Back to the shore on to the rocks? 

There is everybody looking for somebody, the police, attackers, special force, terrorists, whoever or whatever fuck they are.

Still kicking the water to stay on the surface, but now turning on my back, relaxing the body and starting to float. Now taking the best possible position in the water, to save the energy, to be able to stay longer out there…

Yep, that’s my choice… I’m gonna stay here.

Now kicking the water and helping with hands by steady moves, starting to move forward, slowly, in a way towards to the town center.

While forming the plan on my mind, the near and the best future plan, the plan to stay here… here at the sea.

There is only one obvious way to make it, in addition to the fact that I’ll have to keep floating for now, but thinking that the next step would be a boat. And where you can find a nice boat to stay, to stay at the sea, to disappear somewhere there... It’s the harbor.

There are thousands of boats there, and one of those is going to be mine, temporarily.

That’s the plan. The boat is the best way to get away from here, to hide, stay at the sea, at least for a while, possibly for a long while. And to be able to deploy the plan, I take the direction towards to the harbor. Now seeing the lights of the town all over the shoreline, being well aware of the direction, I start swimming towards to the harbor. I know where it is.

It’s the night, looking very quiet despite of the events at the Eden Roc hotel, which I want to get away from. Realizing that the phones in my purse on my hip are gone, thus being unable to check the time, but estimating that regarding to the quietness it must be very early morning nighttime, maybe four or five. It’s the quietest time of the night.

As being a good swimmer, real swimmer, and as being used to open water swimming, I’m now advancing pretty fast. But as the fact is that my shape has gone down in the last couple of days, crucially, I realize that it’s impossible for me to make it in one go.

There is absolutely zero chance that anyone would see me from the rocks or the town. As my current camouflage is the best ever possible at the moment, the water surface being only a huge flat black surface on the horizon, my little dotty head somewhere there… And that gives me option to swim relatively close to the shoreline.

Once in a while I peek towards to the hotel. And I notice that they have boats there, deployed to look for me. Obviously someone has seen me flying down from the roof, or they are looking for whoever it was who blew up the whole place. Organizing the events in a scale seen the first time ever in the town…

Seeing now tens of flashing lights there, somewhere there, understanding that they must have a massive mission ongoing at the moment, searching me and the terrorists, obviously both. 

It’s easy to anyone to put together the fireworks we organized at the hotel, half destroyed abandoned building, and the shootout. A foiled horrendous massacre of the people by the terrorists, but luckily, a successful massacre of the terrorists deployed by me, at the La Mata beach.

Everybody knows that something very serious is up. The first time even happened in this little peaceful town, about an ideal holiday destination. It’s definitely the first time anything like this has happened here, large scale movie type of events, foiled terrorist act on the beach, Hollywood style fight in the van, series of explosions middle of the night, almost destroyed abandoned hotel, flashing lights and emergency vehicles absolutely everywhere, almost all the time. 
WoW!

Now heading to the rocks, leaving the events at the hotel somewhere there behind, choosing the spot under the cliffs, the spot in which the youngsters often are gathering together to have fun, to do cliff jumping from the cliffy rocks above the sea. 

That’s the spot I know very well and for a sentimental reasons I choose it for my short pause, to rest a little, very little while.























CHAPTER 12


It’s quiet, very quiet, and I’m happy of it.

Still relaxing, been here laying on my back on the rocks, just above the sea surface level, under the cliffs, in a kind of a little cave…

This is the pause I surely needed. The next etape, the next phase will be to pass the actual town center, the waterfront center. It’s the kilometers long walking boulevard where thousands of people are enjoying their time, numerous of beaches, every day full of the people especially now in the best summertime. It’s maybe one of the best spots in this town existing.

Normally, there are thousands and thousands of people there, the day and night, but now when the night has fallen to its earliest hours of the next morning, it’s all quiet there. Of course, there are always some, and that’s why I’ll have to stay away from the shore, but I can still follow the shoreline.

I may need to rest once in a while as I still have kilometers of swim ahead. But I’ll go to the shore as little as possible. The best is to stay in swimming in the black sea as it’s about impossible to anyone to spot me there.

So, it’s time to go on. Now standing up and plunging back to the water, luckily warm water, I start swimming again. The best is to get on as fast as I can, away from the events at the old abandoned hotel.

The next I’ll have to go around the rocky cap, then swim all the way past the Los Locos beach, straight forward.

Seeing it now, the large long a bit of a lagoon shaped Los Locos beach. The beach in which I’ve spent countless amount of hours, walking, just being, enjoying my time… But as the reality is as it is at the moment, I’m just going to pass it with straight line, by swimming in the sea.

The next is a rocky shoreline. I would like to go to the shore and walk the same promenade I’ve done hundreds of times. But as the odds are against me I must stay here, swimming. 

Now advancing with pretty fast but steady pace, reaching soon Playa Cura, the town center… When approaching there, seeing about two kilometers long swim ahead, I’m feeling unbelievably tired. 

There are two options, start floating to save the powers, or go on shore and have a little while some sturdy ground under my feet. As feeling seriously tired, now clearly taking a considered risk, I decide to go ashore. A little fact that it’s about must, as my powers are running off, is helping that decision.

Just about reaching the rocks again, greeting a familiar woman’s statue looking at the sea, the sea horizon, with longing look, hoping to have her loved sailor back in safe… Now first sitting down next to her, with compassion, but then laying on my back, on the concrete bench, I look at the sky, the stars.

Love it!

The bright stars blinking on my future expectations are very few, just a pure fact. Letting alone seeing any wishful shooting stars, understanding that there are tough times ahead, and that the forthcoming, it’s only about survival now, at least for now.

Now continuing, saying “hi, must go” to the lonely woman, a green bronze statue, with wishful look on her face. Next plunging back to the water, swimming ahead... But only for a short while at this time, as the long, very long breakwater, a two kilometer long jetty, is the target now.

There is the nightlife still on, or the night guards at the Funfair Park, that’s for sure. So the only option to avoid confronting them is to go along the rocks of the breakwater. 

I would like to visit the Funfair, as I’ve done numerous of times. It’s a very nice little funfair, every year opening over the summertime, having tens of thousands of visitors. But it’s closed anyway at this time of the night, being silent, waiting for a new day and the people, so I’ll just pass it.

Finally, climbing up onto the rocks…

All the way of the jetty’s seaside, is filled with a huge cubic shaped breakwater rocks. That’s a long rocky path which is in front of me. The plan is to run on the rocks a while and then to go to the yacht harbor.

Marina Salina, I love it too. It’s a huge harbor for the boats and yachts, small or big, all has got space. There are the smallest possible boats, jet-skis, but there are also big luxury yachts which cost millions.

My current plan is to pick up one for a short stay, to find some supplies and something to eat and drink. There is always food and practically everything you need in the boats, especially any bigger boats which are for staying at the sea.

The boats are most often full of supplies, and that’s good for me now. Just have to rely on someone else’s stuff, but at least I can pay for it I think. I have some money with me, so the idea is to have some supplies but to pay for it. Maybe I’ll write a note that “sorry, but had to”. And that’s the way to make it even with anyone, whoever the boat owner of whatever boat I’ll manage to get in.

And just when thinking of my generous thoughts the shit happens…

I twist my ankle, badly.

I fall down on the rocks, straight on my knees and next slipping towards the canyon. Yep, these rocks are huge, meters per meters, and there are many meters deep holes in between. And I’m just heading a head first into one rocky canyon. 

I have been jumping from the rock to the rock like a gazelle, but now that fun ended with the most painstaking way. I twist my right ankle, badly, hearing a snap, which means even worse. Ligaments possibly snapping cut, and that’s the worst. Hoping, that maybe just a bit, over-stretching them badly, with just some cut off. But for sure that snap I heard means bad news.

And the next I hit my left knee against the hard rock. Then when trying to maintain some decent balance while preventing me falling between the rocks, I hit the right elbow. And as already going to fall down, the option I was hoping to avoid, I hit my left shoulder next, just about avoiding hitting the forehead too. It’s my right hand which saves me from that, saving me from possibly fainting too, for an unlimited obligatory relaxation.

Right, left, right, left… All hits painstakingly adding wounds into my already so nasty wound collection. 

Luckily the caps between the rocks are narrow enough, the lucky strike saving me from falling down. But now, when sitting down on the rock, expressing the deepest words of wisdom, bursting out of my mouth, in one full sophisticated sentence…

“Fuck, shit, fuck… Shit!”

Yeah, the magic power of row of swearing truly helps. I get courage to stand up and to test the ankle. I wish it can hold me up… I need it, my ankle, the whole leg.

Now feeling barely anything, as the pain is so tense that the mind is kind of blocking it from feeling, I’m aiding it with my automated stimulation in the case of like this, a pain hitting the brains… with full ignorance, pushing the pain away. It’s a trained counter-reaction.

And luckily, as happened so often, it really works, always. Who knows the trick he knows the thing… There are the situations in which feeling the pain is out of choice, and that’s why the trained analgesia takes the place, immediate temporary painkillers delivered by the brains.

The ankle is now numb, but it holds, for now. It has hurt pretty badly, and it will be stiff and swollen next morning, but it holds, which is the main value here. And I go on, at first a bit testing the ankle that does it really holds, but then about normally, just about. 

Now heading to the harbor, I know the place.

The gates are closed and guarded, obviously. So, by my quick conclusion, the best place to enter, to get inside without anyone noticing, is there where the terrace restaurant and the water sports center is, somewhere there. It’s the most remote place in the harbor.

It’s a very nice place, waterfront terrace restaurant, with the water sports center in front of is. I have got coffee there, many times, looking at the water-skiers practicing. I see it being totally quiet now, and also, I see the way in, so I decide to take it. Limping a little heading off to there now…

I’m observing if there are any guards around, but everything looks very quiet. Advancing, and then slipping myself in over the sturdy fence. Making some rattling metallic little noise which only the dogs would hear… At once in, freezing still, listening.

Yep, it’s done, I’m in.

The next is to find a boat, which is pretty easy task at this time, as there are well over thousand options here… But I’ll have to find the one without any high-tech alarm systems, as that would be the worst thing to trigger on at the moment.

Then I see it what I’m looking for, an old, actually very old boat. The boat liked, long time ago in the past.

It brings me some memories from the past, over three decades ago. The boat’s brand is Princess. It was a luxury boat mark back then and it still is. I even recognize the exact model of the boat, so once again, for a sentimental reasons, I pick up that boat.

It’s worn out, done so already a decade ago, being very old, its white paint fallen from numerous of spots, it looking almost like wrecked to the harbor. The boat being maybe the ugliest boat in the harbor at the moment, but I choose it. 

It is a fisherman’s boat, seemingly, as there are many holders fitted for the rods. And for sure the boat like that hardly in equipped with alarms. And for sure, as being a fisherman’s boat, in such a bad and unreliable condition as it seems to be, there is lots of tinned food there, just in case.

Norwegian flag, worn out as well…

Thanks to the Vikings I think, when opening the door. It’s locked, obviously, but to be honest it took me about a second to get in. There is hardly anything to steal, so it would be useless even to lock it. The door is rather closed just to keep the bugs out.

Now entering to the cabin, finding the fridge, peaking in, and seeing only beer there… But I want water. I’m the waterman. Remembering as one of my friend who drank a lot of beer, always, used to say as a comment to the fact that I only drank water, that “the water is good only under the boat”. 

Next opening the doors of the little cabinets in the cabin, looking for cans, to have something to eat. Now finding, lots of them, some Norwegian stuff… 

Reading the labels… 

Yep, I know Scandinavian languages as well, including Finnish, which is, by the way, a language of the origin of aliens. As the only conclusion as thinking of their ancestors and unique genetic genotype, without any similarities with any other humans on the earth, is that they have dropped straight down from the sky. They came from the space.

The Finns are the aliens, real aliens. It’s the only explanation to many odd things in them. For example to the fact that they beat Russians at many wars with them, against the tens folded enemy, with unlimited fire-powers and military… Yeah, the Finns beat them every time they tried, which is a miracle.

Now sorting out the food cans… salmon, codfish, salmon, more fish, and more fish. And in behind the next little door, more fish… Do they eat only fish in Norway? 

But finally, something to eat, it says “kjuttfull pålegg” which means about “meaty-on-the-peroneal-muscle”. Well, I think, at least by my language skills it means some kind of meat, so fine.

I stick the knife in and start eating. Those fifteen years old meatballs at the Eden Roc hotel were good, but the taste of this stuff is completely tasteless. It’s rather water with some odd sunken pap, colorless and tasteless.

But, as the other option was tinned fish in all possible forms of imagination, and as the closes thing with me and fish is that I swim like a fish, and that I like the dolphins swimming with me… I rather eat this pap now. 

At least as being completely tasteless, it’s fine, so I abstain from complaining it tasting anything bad. Completely tasteless pap is okay for now.











CHAPTER 13


There is a little TV there…
I wanna see the news… 
Let’s see…

I pick up the TV. It’s actually a tiny traveler TV, works with the batteries, and thus perfect for the boat.
Does it work? Hope so!
It is very old. I mean veeery old. It looks as old as the boat, which is about forty years…

Actually, it seems that everything is old in this boat. It would be a museum.

I grab the telly and go to the cabin. But before I can test the apparatus I’ll have to cover up the windows and block the light. The TV will have blinking lights and that would be seen from out there. And that would alert the guards. And that’s the worst option here.

At once I have used a blanket and couple of other dirty rags, and managed to cover up all the little cabin windows, and the doorway with the blanket, I take the telly on my lap, and switch it on. But, just some odd, very quiet electrical hissing sound…

I switch if off, trying to prevent it from burning. A little moment and I’ll try again.

When switching it back on the picture comes, black and white, but only for a very short moment, then it disappears. “What a crap!” Who watches black and white TV anymore?

Anyway, I want to see the news, so I’ll need a better boat with a better TV I think. This old nice decaying Princess boat, even though it has certain significance to me, for sentimental reasons from the past, I’ll have to give up and find a better boat. So, I go out.

But, suddenly, now stopping myself from exiting, and before rushing out, I’m sitting down onto the driver’s seat. I ask myself that what’s my plan? What am I going to do?

Do I have some plan?

Yep, the most simple plan... Vanish.

To vanish I’ll need a bit more detailed plan I think. And then the wisdom occurs on my mind, with a sudden realization, me now sighting under a massive pressure of the tiredness, by whispering the words out between the lips… 

“Also, maybe, I should sit down and think, really think.” 

As thinking of the whole thing, it truly has been, as putting it out as simply as can, unbelievably unbelievable, incomprehensible, altogether… The whole thing is unreal.

For a short moment, as thinking of how unreal everything is, I seriously doubt that is it even real? Or is the whole thing just a dream? Like a dream I saw at the hotel. Am I asleep?

Often, very often my dreams are confusingly real. In the past I have many, many times thought that I should write them down, and maybe, some day, when I’m retired, I would write a book, or a few books. 

Many of my dreams are so good, and so real, that they would be book chapters, or rather movie clips. Some are so good that I’ve been wondering that what a great imagination the dream world has got. Just brilliant!

Well, I am retired, so as thinking of it, as thinking of all this “unreal” what has happened in the last couple of days… The time to write a book would be now… Well, in a case I’ll manage to survive. 

The whole story is worth of an action book, or even a movie, full size full action movie. The best ever filmed in Spain. I would the story to the Hollywood. Be rich, and by a yacht.

Funny thing, instantly, as thinking of it, I see Anthony Banderas on my mind, his profile. I see him in charge of the main character. I like his movies, I like the character, I like his style. He’s a real deal, one of the best.

So yep, I would sell the story to Banderas, and he would make a great movie out of it.

But, there is one but… 
Me writing a story…
Sitting down long enough to write a book…
Forget it!

I can make stories, real-life stories. I have made numerous of stories in my life, real, reality stories of the life, some really good ones, but writing about any of it… 

Forget it!

But what comes to the plan, planning, thinking, proper thinking, all that wise-guy stuff… Too tired to do so, and as the fact is…

For a proper consideration you’ll need time, and my time is running short every moment. It’s only a matter of minutes, an hour, or a few hours, maybe a day at the most, when there will be searches here in the harbor as well. So, forget that planning too.

There is a boat sales office in the Marina Salinas buildings. And there they have the keys of the boats for sale. And as the whole area is very well secured, 24/7 guarded, they may have skipped the idea of installing proper alarm systems in the office. And that’s good for me.

So, my sudden short term plan is clear. I’ll go to the sales office, pick up the key of some better boat, a bit better than this, and I’ll check the TV-thing there.

Also, I’ll need an escape route from here, from the town, Torrevieja… And what would be better option than to escape straight from the harbor here to the sea. It’s easy to vanish at the sea. And it’s easy to go wherever I want by the sea.

So, picking up some better boat, maybe a bit bigger than this, maybe a bit stronger than this, rather much stronger, which means also much faster… That sounds to me as a perfect short term plan.

Now peeking out, surveying the neighborhood a little at first, then stepping onto the swimming deck, and then a little hop onto the dock. At first standing still a moment, looking around, but as everything looks quiet, now heading off towards to the buildings.

I know well where the office is, so I just walk straight to there. There are the toilets there as well. And as knowing it I thought that in a case anyone comes, I’ll behave like going to go to the toilets. If it’s the night guard, or actually, in this situation, whoever the person is, there are only a very few options here.

Okay, the fact is, that he’ll see my face, multicolored and badly bruised face. So, apparently I’ll have to offer him a little punch, instant knock out.

That’s a part of my plan now. 

But luckily, I’m the only one around here. And luckily the door is a normal door with a normal lock. And as looking at it, it’s impossible to see any kind of alarm systems anywhere. All fine this far I think.

I knock the door with a sharp punch and it’s open. These doors are so great here… great to brake in only in a few seconds.

Instantly, I can see a key cabin on the wall, and that’s exactly what I wanted to see. And when opening the door, finding out that there is a lot of business here, seeing lots of keys hanging on. Little hooks are holding tens of key chains of the different boats.

I start looking for, now doing a little research of their boat sales catalogue in a form of a key bunches. There is a little plastic key fob with a little note in each bunch, and in that note is written with tiny beautiful letters, which key belongs to which boat. 

Perfect, I must say perfect!

Then I see it… I know the boat. I’ve seen it many times, perfect choice.

Mochi 18 is my “perfect choice” now. It’s a big boat, actually a speed yacht. Stylish, Italian made, 19 meter long, with two power-machines in it, from 800 to 1.000 horses in each, 6.000 liter fuel tank, with all luxury included… Being a real power yacht!

I’m delighted!

Lucky to have it for sale, unable to pay for it, feeling sorry about that, but I’ll have to borrow the boat. Now picking up the key, heading off from the office, closing the door carefully that it looks all okay, and then starting to walk towards to the boat dock which was marked up in the key fob’s note.

At this time, in a case anyone comes, my excuse is that I’m coming from the toilets, obviously. And the rest will be by the very same plan.

Then suddenly, I see the boat. I think it’s the one, even though it’s in a wrong place. 

Instead of being in a marked place, it has been moved into the closest spot next to the main walkway. It has got the best place, apparently to be well seen and hopefully to be sold with the best price possible. 

I wonder that what might be the price, as this kind of a big luxury speed-yacht must cost a lot. Maybe 500.000 bucks, or maybe much more… Actually, as thinking of it, it might be closer to a million. This is already old, but the new boats like this can cost millions. 

But, whatever is the price, it is definitely a perfect choice for my purposes. And, at least I’m going to leave from here with a classy style. And for sure there is the TV there too. Only the last few meters, and I’m able to enter the vessel, now on board. And only a moment, at first testing the first key, then the second, which opens the lock, I’m in.

I look around trying to find the TV, but in vain. Next I go into the main cabin, and instantly when entering I see the TV. Nice, relatively big screen on the wall, in colors at this time that’s for sure, just above a huge king size double bed.

Doing the same trick than before to prevent the light to be seen out there, but at this time with high quality stuff, I manage to block all little windows and the doorway.

What a luxury I think when looking around in the fancy cabin. Even the TV is bigger than the most have got in their houses. And anyway, the standards in the boats are always high, lots of polished wood, master quality and absolutely perfect finishing. 

It’s about always the case when talking about the boats, especially the yachts. Even in that old Princess boat it was still recognizable how it has been made by the best standards. Good quality, that’s what most of the boats are.

Now switching on the TV, big screen with a perfect picture, with the flashing lights shown on it, fire on the rooftop, a beautiful news anchor reporting…











CHAPTER 14


“Shit!” I fell asleep.

At the moment I wake up, the reality check hits with the power of a sledge hammer…

Now peeking out from a little window, I see police cars, flashing lights, policemen running all around the place…

“Fuck!”

I was watching the news, headlights, main stories, and vacuuming information of the latest events, about the terrorists, about the shootout and explosions by odd and unknown actors, some unexplained happenings at the abandoned Eden hotel… 

The fact which I was wondering was, that how come, “odd and unknown”.

In some point I have just fallen asleep without realizing it. Even though it’s more than necessary for me to sleep, to have a proper rest, my plan was totally different. 

I was going to get out from here in a comfortable dim of the night. It was the best possible time for me to sneak out from here, but I screwed it up by falling asleep.

And now, apparently, I’m in a big deep shit…

They are looking for something, maybe just searching, just in case. Maybe they are going through all the procedures, systematically searching at least the most thinkable locations in where the terrorists would be. Or maybe they have some hint that I’m hiding here.

Anyway, the news told that there has been a massive search at the sea. Someone had seen, and actually managed to film something falling down from the rooftop, kind of gliding but falling with a high speed, straight towards to the sea, and then disappearing.

A poor quality of the film helped and I saw by the news how the kite… Well, I know it was a kite, but in a film it’s hard to say what it is… fell down disappearing to the darkness.

In a massive operation by tens of boats, the police, coast guard and some local volunteer groups, have been organized to search… 

And the only thing they were able to find, was an old kite-surfing kite, ripped, most likely unrelated to the current events. That’s what has been told…

The news anchor told that in a case someone fell down from the rooftop, he must have died in a crash to the sea, or afterwards. And that they are still looking for the body, or possible body, an operation continuing, but being unsure if there is anything to find. 

But, the biggest news is the gunfight in the hotel and the explosions. Who are they?

There seems to be a huge confusion in all that. Everybody is trying to figure out that what has happened and who were they. They have found multiple dead men, all well armed and equipped, looking like being part of some special force group… 

But that’s all what they tell. The police and the authorities are telling only peanuts, possibly hiding the truth, but denying their involvement in anything what has happened at the hotel. 

The people are wondering, some, maybe the most of them, doubting that the authorities are telling the truth. Most of the people, as well as the news organizations, are very suspicious and all seem to be questioning the authorities, which is very understandable.

But, the authorities are assuring, that they rather need information and cooperation from the people, in a case anyone has seen anything. Or will see anything at all which would be somehow related to the latest horrible events, or to the terrorist attack at the beach. 
They are urging people to contact the police, and even reminding that everybody have an obligation to report to the police in a case they see or know anything at all.

And why is that?

They are also looking for the “Matador” a man who the people has given a hero name of Matador, the most glorious bullfighter personage, of a lonely man who killed the terrorists and managed to foil the horrific attack.

And as the people are celebrating the hero, Zorro, the police are urging that they must report to the police if anyone knows the man. They are clearly afraid that some who might know something is holding up the information, or even that the people are willing to rather help the hero to escape than to let the police to arrest him. 

The killer of eight terrorists, and possibly also the killer of five unknown attackers in the hotel, has got a hero’s status by the people. He is now, also, as it seems to be officially a case as the police got the name same as well, called the “Matador”, bullfighter.

But, he has disappeared, and the police are looking for him, almost more than the terrorist, as they believe that the Matador knows something. And, the fact is that he killed many heavily armed terrorists by bare hands…

Who is the man? How did he manage to kill the terrorists? What is his background? How was he there, coincidentally or on purpose? Is he part of some organization?

There are numerous of questions, asked absolutely by everybody, by the police, by the people, by the news anchors, by the worldwide broadcasting…

And, as oddly as it is, also by me… All the very same questions, at least regarding to the terrorists and the attackers…

Well, on the other hand, the fact is that I know the most of anything… Or maybe the most? Actually…

As thinking of it, whoever was, or is, behind the terrorist attack, and the attack in the hotel, in a case the authorities are telling the truth about their un-involvement, they are the ones who definitely know the most.

And as thinking of that, all the odds in all this, all the weird things in the whole picture, all the alarming bells on my mind, all the abnormalities and un-matching inaccuracies…

The whole thing is just out of sense, rather irrational, or absurd, being totally unreal and unbelievable. And the fact that the terrorists attacked at the hotel, with full force, senselessly, just to catch me or to kill me, or what was the whole thing…?

Incomprehensible, madness, unreal, unbelievable… those are the words popping up on my mind over and over again.

And what can I do? Should I contact the police and tell at least all that little what I know? Should I turn in? Or should I just get away and vanish?

Or… maybe the craziest idea of all… Should I try to figure out that what’s going on?

Anyway, now peeking out again, seeing the police securing the area, them emptying the whole place, the whole harbor, ordering the people out from the restaurants…

Well… That can only mean one thing. 

They have got a hint. Maybe the clerk at the boat office, whoever went there first, noticed that someone had broken in, and called the police. Maybe it was a Norwegian man, whose boat I was visiting, and whose scrappy telly I left into the cabin’s table. I should have put it back where it was.

But if it was a clerk in the boat sales office, have they noticed that a one particular key is missing. In a case that’s the case, they know very well where I am.

And in that case, I start realizing, just right now, that they must have the whole area being secured, or under the operation. And that also means that they are barricading the entrance to the harbor, in this case the way out as thinking of me.

And as thinking of that, the question is, in what stage they are in deploying their plan of a blockade. Have they already secured the area, blocked the waterway out, completed the blockade, completely surrounding my position now…? Or are they just doing it at the moment, with big rush, deploying a full blockade, including closing down the only exit for me from here?

And as thinking of that, hoping that they are still searching, or doing preparations… Or maybe they are only about making sure that whoever has broken in to the office… was just looking for something valuable, such a thing as stealing a boat…

Yep, what else can be something valuable in the boat sales office than a valuable boat? And it surely means that they have checked all the keys through, and that they apparently well know which key is missing. They know that it’s the yacht I’m on board right now.

It also explains pretty much why they are apparently avoiding form approaching this particular boat as all of the policemen seem to be a bit further on. And why they are emptying and securing the area, all the restaurants and the entire harbor.

And as that seems to be the case, evacuation of the harbor, there are only bad options planned for me. It means that there will be full scale operation soon, very soon. It’s only a matter of the time, a very short matter. Maybe they’ll take it easy, and ask me to surrender first, or whoever they think might be here. Or maybe they are just waiting for something, but doing their job to state the siege, and secure the perimeter…

Well… For sure, there are special force and heavily armed branches coming. The only possible thinkable option is that they are making it as guaranteed as anything can be. To be sure that the terrorists, or the Matador, possibly both malefactors will be captured… And that those branches are taking their positions just right now.

And as I’m about 169 percent sure that being the case just right now…

So will be! I put the key into the lock, being ready to start the motors, and say:

“Sorry, but gonna got to go”


























CHAPTER 15


Now turning the keys, starting the motor one on, starting the motor two on…

About or over two thousand horse powers start growling…

Saying… “WOW! This is going to be great!”

I used to have a boat, pretty fast one, only about ten meter long, but nice and fast. And I used to play with it, ride as a jet-ski, with high speed, sharp turns, curving, making waves for myself, curving away and back, to have nice jumps…

Yes, I know, the size of a boat like that is for nice calm driving, and definitely made for steady cruising instead of jumping. But it was such a great fun, and it made me laugh, laugh out loud. It may have been bothered some, especially as thinking that I used to do that at the nighttime, because that was the only time I had free time back then. Yep, I used to work hard, long days, every day…

I took long leaps with the boat. And also, as it had got lots of power, so I used to enjoy the roughest water conditions, biggest waves, as it was great to push through the biggest ones, the water splashing over the boat. 

Yep, sounds a bit crazy, must admit, but that made me enjoy and laugh. Maybe it was the adrenaline again, but it was truly great.

So, this boat is even in a totally different category. It’s bigger, it’s stronger, and it’s faster. It’s a real power-yacht. And that’s why, now when turning the motors on, feeling the power horses growling, vibrating the hull, excitement accelerating my heart pumping, faster and stronger.

I can feel it, adrenaline burst in a moment I’m prepared to go, when I’m thinking of that great ride I’m gonna have, in a situation as it is. And as feeling the adrenaline filling my veins once again, after those few hours of relaxation, the feeling is only getting better.

As feeling the pain disappearing, having the best cure and painkiller in the world released, rushing with high-speed into my blood circulation, now making me feeling good, being together with 2.000 horses of the boat, all wild Mustangs, waiting for my command to release all the power they got, wildness, rough hardcore power…

Now, giving a bit of gas, kind of preempting, the feeling and excitement is only getting better. Ready to go!

But, at the moment when I’m going to go to untied the ropes, front and back, I see the policemen running towards to the boat. So, surely, they have been aware me being here, and they noticed that I started the motors.

And as I see them pulling off the handguns from the holders, unsealing the concealed, the same time when running towards me, I know that this was going to be a trap. And as thinking of it the harbor is definitely one of the best places ever to trap someone, closed area, only certain exits, waterway easy to block… seems like perfect, for them.

But, I have a bit different thoughts, a few things to do and absolutely zero interest in many weeks lasting interrogations, and litigations as I’m supposed to be held accountable of killing a bunch of terrorist, massive publicity… “Oh, gosh…!” 

All in a situation in which I have pretty much zero answers to offer to them, being unable to tell too much of anything, regarding to the past and myself, it only making the whole thing worse. 

So, it’s better to go, at least I’m going to try. 

How about the ropes? The boat is still connected to the dock and pillars. And, are those policemen really going to shoot?

Now looking at them, approaching the boat by running, guns on their hands, ready to confront the one or ones in the boat, maybe even preparing to come on board… The time running short, for sure it is. And as understanding that there has to have tens of policemen, reinforcements, special guys, on foot, by the boats, possibly on the air… 

Yep, pretty sure about that too…

The situation is getting tense, a bit too tense, and it’s going to escalate. Only a very short moment, it blinks into my mind, the option of letting them capture me, to avoid any harm to anyone, especially to the police forces, as there is an enormous respect to them packed on my mind towards them.

One of the most needed and the most essential profession in this word are the police, all security and emergency branches, including the armed forces. There is enormous respect towards them, by me. 

But, the disturbing fact is that the people, often, see them as some annoyance, always controlling the traffic, or whatever it is, even though they are just doing their work, for the common best for everyone, and everybody’s safe and security.

There are numerous of instances, some actually malicious, even spreading hate and misinformation against the police, trying to ignite the people being against them. Something weird and very unfortunate!

The police and all the safety and security branches are doing their job, dangerous and very challenging job, with the basic salary. They are earning the most basic salaries even thought their job is one of the most demanding, them being every day in danger. The danger, even the life danger, is being present even then when everything seems to be fine. It just belongs to their job.

So, with the warm feelings towards the guys approaching me, being ready to shoot at me, I’m serving them with a little pleasant surprise, for sure annoying, but harmless. The one I used to trick the others long time ago.

I turn the engines a bit downwards, being about half a meter below the water surface. I see the policemen on the dock, still running, about fifteen meters away now.

And I turn the gas on, halfway, motors suddenly roaring, a massive water pillar rising to the highs, tens of cubic meters at once…

The water pillar, in a bit of a form like a tornado, is rising. The policemen seeing it, their eyes following the rising water, their mouths opening, their running suddenly stopping, them wondering…

They see a huge water tornado rising to the air, about five or six meters high…

And tens of cubic meters of water, turns downwards, straight down, above the policemen, their mouths now being wide open.

“Sorry about that” I say, at the moment when I see their amazed faces, their surprised grimace, eyes big as golf balls… them disappearing under and into the water, the tornado descending on them, hitting with crushing power, literally splashing them down.

I would laugh, but as turning the rotors down, all 2.000 wild Mustang horses now idling, only for a few seconds more, waiting a tiny moment, for a launch of all the horses at the same time.

Finally, I push the gas front, full throttle, and the boat scoot forward. It almost jumps, the water in the rear suddenly exploding. The boat takes off so fast that it’s almost incomprehensible. It just practically fires forward almost as a bullet. The sharp bow towards the harbor buildings…

Nineteen meters long speedboat explodes in to the action, all the horses at the same time. Motors roaring, now turning the wheel to the left, the ropes snapping cut all at the same time, without any slowing down effect against the wild released Mustangs.

I must turn sharply left to avoid hitting the other boats, trying to avoid otherwise an apparent series of collisions. But the start being a bit too powerful, my joyful adrenaline filled act of “fool gas full”… it’s unavoidable. 

Being just about narrowly able to crash straight to the other boats with full mass, the side and the rear of my yacht shaped rocket is wiping off the bows of the docked boats. They are snapping like matches, unable to match the mass of my Mochi.

“Sorry about that too”, I think.

The start being a bit too rough, in such a little mooring area, with such a big power-yacht type of a speedboat as this, the damage to the other boats is unavoidable. I crush a few of them, causing big waves at the same time as well, the waves which start swinging all the boats, them now banging hard against the each others.

Now releasing the power a little, holding the powers, I turn again to the left, now towards to the exit, to get away from the harbor. At the same time I can hear bullets snapping against the windows, and to the side of the boat, with steady serial tapping, constantly, like someone sharply knocking and trying to get in.

The boat rushes on now, straight on, me giving the gas, more gas, pushing the gas bars forward, to speed up fast. But… straight ahead, there where I should exit the harbor area, I see some boats, the coast guard boats, with some other boats.

They have blocked the whole place, entirely, with multiple vessels. And that forces me turning to the right, the speed being already too high to even slow down in time.

Now heading off to the other dock area, passing by the Real Club Nautico and the Club Nautico Marina International, well over a thousand boats there, from the smallest to the biggest… Great clubs, both of them, would have joined one, some day, but now… Feeling sorry again as my waves, inevitably, are going to cause quite a series of collusions there, with a horrible mess afterwards.

I just visited there a few days ago, nice guys giving me all information needed, me looking for mooring for the boat… Yep, I was considering of having a boat here, buying one, possibly a great made in Spain yacht, Gallart 15 or 16, as it would have been maybe the most comfortable way to spend the pleasant time around here... 

But, that plan getting scrapped just right now, too. Just like so many other plans, all the plans of nice and peaceful retirement days, in this town, my favorite town, on the beaches, great beaches around here, with numerous of different sportive activities, outgoing… 

All that is scrapped now, all gone by the events, the terrorist attack, and all unreal what has happened afterwards.

At the same time, when heading off towards the beach, with high speed, riding nineteen meters long speed-yacht, straight ahead of me, the beach full of people, hundreds of people…

“Shit!”












CHAPTER 16


Crashing to the beach… Out of question!

I turn the wheel lightly to the right, then soon after sharply to the left, now curving with high speed about hundred meters from the beach, heading away from the people, now towards to the salt marina.

And what happens, I realize at the moment it’s about done, the waves of a yacht like this, which my sharp curve sends moving, a tsunami like big waves towards to the beach…

I would take it back but it’s done already. It’s going to cause a horrible mess at the beach, the small “tsunami” of the boat rolling deep on to the sand, hitting the holidaymakers, sending hundreds of the people with their belongings moving along the water, in a beautiful orchestrated mess.

Now heading towards the blockade, targeting the access out, the only option I can see. There is kind of a hole, between the coast guard patrol boats, coincidentally made by the very same Gallart builder I was considering to buy. Between the two sturdy built boats, there are a couple of pieces of plastic, and that’s what I’m targeting now.

Two smaller glass fiber boats, maybe fast, but weak, that’s kind of an opening in the blockade, as I see it. At least as considering of the mass of my boat and its speed, it’s going to be an opening.

When pushing the gas forward, with full throttle, releasing all 2.000 horses at the same time, the boat firing towards to the boats… I see men jumping away from them.

Yes, that’s what I thought is going to happen. 

Now only about twenty five meters away from the boats, the cap between us closing down fast, me preparing to the crash, still squeezing the throttle full, as full as it can be, the bow targeting the fiber boats… 

Feeling the most powerful excitement, I hit the boats with a loud crash.

Even though my nineteen meters long boat is heavy, and even though I have got lots of speed with enormous mass, the crash against the boats feels like hitting the wall.

But, realizing now, in a blink of an eye, I smash straight through the barricade. Now exiting the harbor, with full speed, all horses racing, further away from the patrol boats, I can feel the endorphin dose with steady supply of adrenaline doped satisfaction filling my brains. 

“I knew it’s going to be great”.

But where to go? The question appears on my mind now when escaped from the blockade.

At the same time when noticing the patrol vessels turning and speeding up to follow me, thinking that it’s pretty much a waste of the fuels from them, the most serious question is that where to go.

The full scenery filling the line between the water and sky, the horizon in front of me, is the only limit. That means, just as I have always thought when looking at it, that there is the whole world the only limit. Meaning that by the sea you can go everywhere in this world, absolutely everywhere.

There is Spain, north or South, or France, Italy, Greece, all places in where I have used to be a lot in the past, all which I like, used to like. But there are other directions as well, even Africa… 

Now heading to the north, releasing a bit the throttle to save the fuel and motors, a little short term action plan is forming on my mind, now starting to estimate the other, more practical limits I have. 

How much fuel I have! How far I can go?
What are the police and the coast guard going to do? Will they send the helicopter after me?
What would be the best option to be able to vanish from their radars?

And most of all, the question remains, where would I go? Where am I going to go? What is going to be my chosen destination? 

I’ll have to find a place, to hide. It’s time to go underground, but practically it just means that I’ll have to find a place where to be in peace, unnoticed and unrecognized.

As thinking of the news, it’s easy to guess that the place like that is well far from here. Of course, all the biggest cities are the best to hide, as usual, as too much people there to anyone to find anyone wanted. Also some remote countryside would fit, as only a serious lack of the people is the present there.

But on the other hand, as thinking of the terrorists, and the fact that they were hunting me down… as thinking of the attack…

But why? Why did they do what they did? What sense is in that?

It looks more like kind of a retaliation, revenge in a form of killing me. But why? It’s absolutely senseless them to take action like that. They were risking too much, and many more of them got killed.

Actually, it maybe being the reason of retaliation… Too many of them got killed.

By the way, how did they manage to escape as well? There were many more of them at the hotel, I’m sure about that. I heard them, many of them. Five of them got killed, but there were some others. How did they escape as the news mentioned only the bodies?

Very odd, seriously odd! The whole thing smells like a sewer. And as thinking of it, all the odds being the only facts in this case, there is much more in it, I’m sure about that. There are way too many odds in this case, it to be just a coincidence.

And, as thinking of that, the most wanted deed is emerging on my mind. I would like to know who they really were. But how?

That’s what I’m going to figure out. At first how, and then the answers… All the right answers are somewhere there.

With this surprising will emerging on my mind, I see the third option for vanishing, in addition to the biggest cities or the most remote countryside… And that’s just about wherever the leads are taking me.

Back to the business!

It means that there has to be a bigger plan, some way to get them to expose themselves. And as thinking of that, the best bite for them… Yep, right! It’s right here riding this gorgeous yacht.

Now enjoying the most enjoyable ride with a magnificent yacht, the first short term plan is forming on my mind. It has been such a rush, just crashing from the clash to the other, from one death to the second death, in a row of death dangers…

It’s time to do something with it.

At first I’m going to head straight forward further away from Spain, actually towards the Sicily, in Italy. It’s only a few hours to the night, the time left before the darkness finally descends. I must go as far as I can, to avoid them from finding me, anyone, the terrorists or the police, just vanishing to the seas, to the eternity of it.

There will be searches, already organized, already deployed somewhere behind me. So it’s better to get as far as I can before they’ll get the operations properly on.

Then I’ll take a sharp turn to the right, to the south, taking the opposite direction. Practically, I’ll head off back to the Spain, but this time to the south. And before making any final decisions I’m going to use the radiophone of the boat, to contact a few serious connections I have, good ones, from the past. 

And in some point I’m going to rest, in a shade of the night, I’ll have to have some rest. It’s essential, for the recovery as well as the ability to carry on. Crucially essential!

So, the plan is… Maybe about two hours towards the Sicily, slightly turning to the south, then a few hours to the south towards Africa, and then stopping for a little pause, in the middle of the Mediterranean sea. And while having much needed rest I’ll contact to the people I know.

I’ll ask that what they do know about the events in Torrevieja, about the terrorist, about what’s going on and where, about anything... They must have been following the events, maybe they even know the ones involved, possibly even the fact that the one in the action was me.

I’ll need some information. And then it depends on them what’s going to happen next. Are they interested involving the case, or are they rather recommending me that “just keep going and vanish”. Stay retired!

But for sure they’ll help me. At least they’ll give me some supplies, and possibly whatever I need. But, as thinking of the severity and nastiness of that what was going to happen on the beach, and the attack in the hotel, I would believe that the organization behind the people I know, is definitely interested in finding out some answers, and possibly also in finding the terrorists and attackers… 

It’s so weird, unbelievable!

Now whispering, “There is more in that, for sure there is.”
























CHAPTER 17


“Can you hear me?”

“Barely”
“We got a bad line”
“Speak louder”

I’m asking with louder voice…

“Okay. Can you hear me now?!”

“Yes, but wait, I’ll get her, she wants to speak with you”

“Okay!”

Now wondering, that who is she?
The man answering was total stranger to me…

The radiophone is hissing, and I’m waiting for “she” coming to talk with me. It takes maybe five minutes, but it feels like an eternity.

But finally I can hear how someone is picking up the handset, and then about five seconds later saying with sharp commanding voice:

    • What’s up, identify yourself.”

As being about sure I recognize her, I say with a loud, surprised and delighted voice:

    • Rosa, is it Rosa!
    • Is it YOU, Rosa!

And she fires back:

    • Shit! What a fuck are you doing!?
    • You shout out my name over the lines.
    • And repeat it many times.
    • Have you forgotten all manners, man!

Ups, I think. And when I’m just about going to answer something, she fires more:

    • And stop shouting at me!
    • We got the line fixed and I can hear you now, way too well.

Okay, I think. But as being still amazed that it really is Rosa, old dear friend from the past, a very dear, I’m still mumbling with my words. And she goes on now laughing at me:

    • “Matador”, you’ve got a new name.
    • Hah!
    • Old bulldozer is now bullfighter.
    • Do you like your new name?

Well, actually I do, I think. And I’m just about going to say something smart back, but she continues:

    • We saw you at the news.
    • How did you end up into that kind of situation? 
    • What a heck were you doing there?
    • Are you on some unauthorized mission?

Huh! What a heat, I think. And I open my mouth trying to figure out that how would I explain the whole thing:

    • Umm…

But Rosa fires more:

    • I know, it’s just you and your thing. 
    • You always end up into some troubles.
    • Is it really so difficult for you to stay away from them?
    • Why do we always have to expect the worst, something like that from you?

Huh! What can I say? I think.

There are troubles everywhere I would say. Walking troubles and you call them as simply as the people. Big part of the business, the business of life, is confronting all kinds of troubles in a form of some idiot.

So, I say:

    • Hey, wait!

But, when I finally get something to say she interrupts me:

    • You are retired, man.
    • You said that you quit, and that you want to take it easy.
    • Your plan was to be a “normal”, travel and see the world.
    • You had so innocent plans of “total relaxation” having idling time in some remote place for the rest of your life.

But now it’s my turn to interrupt her:

    • Hey! Hey, wait!

But, she keeps firing:

    • And you end up to Spain, to some little town called Torrevieja, middle of thousands of the people on the beach…
    • And you decided to have fun by killing eight terrorists…
    • Man!! 
    • Is that some kind of a new way of “total relaxation”?

She is ridiculing me, and my ears start getting reddish now. I know that they are laughing at me there, and that’s why I must fire back:

    • Hey, you! Listen!
    • You are the…!

But, typical Rosa, always having the words, the first, middle and the last, keeps mocking me, mercilessly: 

    • We should have put you into some lonely island middle of the Pacific.
    • You always have to be under the control, or you end up beating up someone for “good reasons”.
    • But what a heck made you to kill all those guys?
    • How about some a little more tender approach, for example knocking them out and detainment?
    • Or at least leaving couple of them alive so there would be now some answers to the endless questions…

Okay, I think, let it all come, I wait.
So, I just wait and decide to listen all what she has to say. 
It’s useless to me even try to say anything. She is the one who talks, like always.

But… Silence… Maybe fifteen seconds…

Okay, she asked, apparently now waiting for me to answer. And as, finally, I got a say, I use the opportunity and say:

    • Well, you know, it was a bit like…
    • The whole thing was, you know…
    • Umh… I mean that… you know?

I shut my mouth being embarrassed now. I know that there is a group of them listening to this conversation, and it really is getting embarrassing now.

Then I hear her laughing and saying:

    • Hah, haa!
    • I’m just kidding, teasing you.
    • I know.

A little pause, but then she asks, and now it sounds like something serious:

    • But really, was it just a coincidence, or were you following some leads?
    • And if so, you should have informed us.
    • The whole situation is pretty bad now, a horrible mess.
    • A whole Spain is behind you, hunting you down, and just about everybody wants to find you.
    • The police, coast guard, special force, even military.
    • It’s going to be difficult to take you in.

Thinking, that “yep, that’s true for sure”, I’m now wordless. And she continues:

    • You are such a “solo” now. 
    • To be honest we would consider of leaving you on your own.
    • It’s a terrible mess and it’s going to be difficult to hide you.
    • You even let the people film you and acted as some film star.
    • You bowed like a “matador” after slaughtering those men in the van.
    • Was that really needed?

Huh! 
What can I say? How can I defend myself? 
It’s all true what she is saying… 

And I know that many things would have been different, or that I would have done things differently, or that the whole thing would have been handled differently.

On my mind, I’m realizing now that the whole thing was very unreal. It was like a nightmare, truly, a bad one. Like the dream about it I saw afterwards in the Masa hotel…

Actually, it all looked like “well controlled action clip”. And that’s how I saw it before Rosa’s barrage of words and claims.

She is clearly waiting for me to say something. But what can I say? Some long explanation sounding like a row of excuses?

The radio is hissing now, waiting for someone to say something. And as it seems to be that she makes all talk here, I’m the one who is just waiting for her to continue.

And just when I thought that it’s better to wait, she says:

    • We have decided to take you in.
    • But there are lots of things which have to be done, and lots of questions which need to be answered.
    • We have decided to have an operation on this, continuing from right now on.

A little pause, and then she is continuing:

    • And you are the bait we must use.
    • We are making plans, even though it’s very difficult to make any sense in anything in this case.
    • But it seems that they are hunting you, the terrorists, or whatever they are…
    • And that’s why we need you.
    • But we’ll have to let them to find you, at the same time when preventing the police from doing so…
    • So, we need some time to make plans.

Okay, I think. Sounds good, perhaps… 

At least I’m having help now and this senseless bouncing from one “narrow death” to another ends, and there is a proper plan with controlled options in place.

I like it, so I say her:

    • I like it.
    • What do I do?

She is answering immediately:

    • Stay out, stay there.
    • We’ll contact you soon, very soon, now when we know where to find you.

It’s my turn to interrupt her now, and I must say sharply:

    • You said that you’ll “take me in”.
    • And now you say that “stay out”.
    • What’s that?

She laughs at a little, and replies:

    • We’ll take you in, but you must stay out for now.
    • Or perhaps we’ll let you to be there, or get you somewhere in a way that they can find you.
    • You are the bite.
    • It’s the only way to find them, to let them find you, as then we’ll be able to follow their tracks.

Yep, understood, I think, and I say it:

    • Yep, I understand.
    • And the only sense in that bullshit is that they are going to have a new chance to kill me.
    • I have been dying, almost, already too many times.
    • And I think that I’m running out of my cat-lives, already used so many, and the next time may be the last. 
    • Is that in your plan too?

I must ask sarcastically. Now continuing:

    • But, honestly, it’s the truth and well possibility. 
    • Whoever are those terrorists, are death serious in hunting me… 
    • And their main mission seems to be to kill me, for some reason.
    • Have you thought about that?

I’m serious in asking, and I say:

    • I’m getting bored in dying. 
    • The most recently, it has been too close too many times, and the next can be the last, the last call.

In about a second she answers with iron-hard unhesitant voice:

    • You are in now, I said so.
    • It means that it’s your job now.
    • So do your job.

I must blurt:

    • Great!
    • Sounds fucking great!

As an answer I can hear her voice saying:

    • Just wait, we’ll make plans and we’ll contact you again.
    • Just wait.









CHAPTER 18


After she said what she said and shut down the connection, I have been sitting on the driver’s seat thinking of that what to think about what. And the most sophisticated thing what blurred out from my mouth right after the call was, after the last ominous words…

“Fuck!”

“Just Wait”… Am I now waiting? And what I am now waiting? Sudden death coming?

The fact is that those “terrorists” have got resources, and I mean real resources.

That sudden death may come in a form of a missile. I’m pretty sure about that. And as being pretty sure about that it also means that those terrorists are some “very specific” terrorists. To be honest, they rather seem to be some mercenaries.

And as soon as I got the revelation formed on my aging brain cells, I push the button to contact them again, immediately.

I hear a man’s calm voice asking:

    • Yeah, what’s up?

And I say:

    • Have you thought that those so called terrorists might be mercenaries?
    • And that they may send me a missile…

He interrupts me and says sharply:

    • Yes, it’s a radio silence now.

Oh, thanks I think. Good that they have thought about it. I smash the handset onto the instrument board, hit my fist against the other seat next to me, sending it whirling, and…

“Fuck!”

They shut me down, and disconnected the call. Great indeed!

So I wait, perhaps a missile coming, take it, that’s my job now.

I would say that I have a say in it. I just have to figure it out.

On my opinion, I’m out, retired. It is someone else’s turn to wait and get himself killed. My mission is surviving now.

I must think, at least now I have time to think.

At the same time when opening the fridge door, going to make some sandwiches, but stopping and standing still, just looking into the fridge, the door open. 

Now starting to slip salami slices from the package, putting some cheese on it, making simple rolls, throwing it into my mouth, eating straight from the fridge, zipping juice from the bottle, adding cucumber and red pepper into the rolls, the door still open…

Yes, bad habit I admit, but I’m thinking.

Even though I’m now floating middle of the sea, maybe about five kilometers from the coast line, somewhere about hundred kilometers from Malaga, and even though it’s as quiet night as quiet can be now, the fact is that someone will find me, that’s for sure.

So, how long I can wait, just wait as they said. They should contact me again, I think, and soon, very soon. We are running out of time, soon, very soon I’m afraid, being actually sure about it.

Still as eating, my bad habit snacks straight from the fridge, is my very own plan having its form now. Waiting is boring, so there must be another option. 

How long do I have to wait?
An hour, a day, a few days…
And what I am waiting for, a missile?

The most expected visitor would be the coast guard. There must be a massive search ongoing. On the other hand, it’s pretty much impossible to find anyone at the seas, as the search area is huge and even thought they can use the radars there are thousands of boats everywhere.

As thinking of it the most supposed option is that there are the police in every harbor in Spain now, and that the coastal towns and areas are now under a serious surveillance.

So, here at the sea, it’s the best to be waiting, if that’s what has to be done.

Suddenly the radio makes cracking sound and I can hear Rosa asking:

    • Matador, are you there.

Matador? But answering anyway:

    • Yep.

She says sharply:

    • Oh, wait a moment something is up.

She disappears from the line and the radio goes silent again. And I think “Okay, I wait.”

But while waiting to hear her voice again, I start remembering about the time when I met with Rosa the first time, and the time we have shared together. It’s impossible to forget, as that woman is truly, dynamite.

She’s a sexy package, smart and sharp. She has got a bit of a military type direct approach in everything, being in command, and liking of doing so. Her best abilities are all what comes into combat, and in that sense she is one of a kind. She is the best in action, definitely, one of the best of all times.

Well equipped in all senses, also with straight humor, which is one of the highest grades in any mission and in all ranks. Her experience of decades, also numerous of hardcore services on field, capability to run through any roles in action needed, makes her one of the best ever seen.

But, there are only a few who knows all about her, if any. She is actually very extrovert but there is a vast secret part in her. And there is hardly anyone really, who knows what she has gone through, anywhere. There are many who know parts of something about, including me, but only she knows the whole past.

Maybe the best way to describe her is to say that “she is one of a kind”.

And the first time when I met her, that was in action. It was all of a sudden action, straight forward, action in action, in the most unforgettable ways. We managed to handle a big fish together, enjoyed of it and felt like belonging together.

But then, right after the first time we met, sudden feelings of togetherness, the following missions took us apart, and we were deployed in totally different locations in this world. Since that it has been, occasionally, we meet, shortly, have some special moments, action filled moments, and then we rift on our different ways again.

There is certain “always there” common ground between us, but it’s just there, with over two decades long lack of the time to enjoy of it, be together, really even know each other. It has been the same, always, and that’s the only expectation, anytime we’ll come together again… rift apart.

It’s in a way sad, but it’s great anyway. Good in a way it is.

Suddenly, cutting off my deep yearning thoughts I can hear her voice again:

    • Matador, are you there?
    • Where are you?
    • I mean that what is you location?

I check the location from the radar and say:

    • 36, 28, 24 and 3, 27, 07.

She replies:

    • Okay wait.

And as getting used to waiting, I’m doing so.
But only about 25 seconds when she is saying:

    • We got you.
    • Good location, actually very good.
    • We’re actually quite close.
    • We decided to take you in, and then expose somehow that they can find you.
    • It’s hardly possible that they can anyhow find you at the sea, so we’ll have to do it on land.
    • We have a plan.

Okay, I’m now asking:

    • So where should I go?
    • Will I come where you are, or will you pick me up?
    • As you know the whole coast must be full of police forces now, all branches.

She replies:

    • Yes, we know.
    • We’ll pick you up.
    • Actually, we’ll come to get you, and you’ll have to prepare.

As she keeps a little pause I say:

    • Okay, just tell me what I have to do.

Maybe only 15 seconds and she is continuing:

    • You must be able to sink the boat.
    • Otherwise the police will find it. 
    • And we’ll have to leave it anyway, so it’s better to disappear.

She keeps a little pause again and then says:

    • Do what you can to change your look.
    • How badly you are wounded?
    • And how is your face?
    • I mean, that in a video the people had been filming, you looked so bad that it made you completely unrecognizable, which is good.
    • But can you even be seen?
    • Do we have to use the burqa or veil to hide you?

Yep, I think, maybe a good trick to be incognito, as only the eyes can be seen.

I’m now looking at myself from reflection of the window, and I say:

    • I think it looks pretty bad.
    • But I can mask myself enough, so forget the burqa.
    • It was a joke I guess, right?

She ignores my question and directs:

    • Okay, do that.
    • In twenty minutes we’ll send you a location of the pickup point. 
    • Meanwhile, do all necessary preparations… regarding to sinking the boat.
    • We’ll bring you stuff so you can prepare yourselves at once we’ll pick you up, before landing onshore.

Then she adds, simply:

    • We’ll contact you.

But, just when I’m going to shut down the connection, I say rapidly:

    • Hey wait!
    • I can hear something.

Now listening a moment… 

For sure I can hear something, and as listening it’s coming closer, for sure I know what it is. I say to Rosa who is still waiting:

    • It’s a helicopter, I’m sure about it.
























CHAPTER 19


    • Yep, it’s a helicopter.
    • Do you know anything about it?

Rosa replies:

    • Negative. 
    • But we see it now on our radars.
    • It’s approaching you fast.
    • Definitely coming to you.

So, they have found me. But who are they?
I say to the radiophone:

    • But who are they?
    • Terrorists or the coast guard?
    • Do you have any idea?
    • What to expect?

At the same time I start the motors, as it’s time to go. On the move it’s more difficult them to do anything, try to get into the boat, or even follow. I may be able to get rid of them, at least for a little while.

I say to Rosa:

    • It’s time to go, I’ll come closer.
    • But where to go?
    • Where you’ll pick me up?

I decide to wait a little. Both motors are on now, ready to go, but I wait.

It’s better to see what they are going to do. There is a little chance that they’ll just make a flyby, or that it’s just a coincidence.

I switch all the lights off now, just in case.

Then I hear Rosa’s voice on the radiophone:

    • Wait and see what’s it about.
    • If they are after you, then your position has been revealed.
    • Maybe it’s this unsecured radio line.
    • They have been able to search and find the channel, and that’s why they know your location now.

Yep, we were very careless when revealing my location on the radiophone. But, it was unlike that anyone would have been caught the signal so quick, rather impossible.

But now the fact is that it’s impossible for us to deal with the pick-point location. And Rosa knows it well.

    • I’ll see what happens and what I can do with it.
    • And I’ll contact you later.
    • Maybe it’s just a flyby, hope so.

But just when I have said that, I think that my hope is useless tool now, as I see that the helicopter is coming closer. I talk to Rosa:

    • It’s coming closer, and it’s definitely coming here.
    • It’s descending now, fast, and it’s heading straight towards me.

I’m looking at the lights of the helicopter, now coming closer, fast. Both hands on the gas, ready to push them forwards, ready to let all the horses run.

Thinking… What options do I have?

The boat is fast but the helicopter is faster. I can try to use the darkness, do some maneuvers, but it’s useless as they have radars anyway, and they can see me.

I say to Rosa:

    • This was a nasty surprise.

At the moment I say it, I can hear machine gun firing. The bullets are hitting the side and the roof of the boat…

Immediately, I push the gas full, pretty much into the bottom. Both motors roar, 2.000 horse powers, and the boat jumps forward.

The bullets stop hitting the boat, apparently now ending up in to the water when the boat suddenly moved. But it takes only for a moment, and then I can hear the bullets riddling the boat again.

I turn sharply to the left, straight on for a moment, then to the right. That’s about the only thing I can do, zigzag, to shuffle them off, or at least to prevent them from riddling the boat with continuous fire. 

But once in a while I hear the bullets hitting the boat, loud sharp snapping bangs. I know that there is a hole in the boat in every bang, and ultimately they will hit something crucial enough to stop the boat functioning.

I hear Rosa yelling to the radiophone:

    • You are in a very good position!
    • Come closer to the coast!
    • See you!

Yep, sure, I want to see her. But, I hope I’ll be alive to do so.

The bullets are hitting the boat again. I’ll do the same, at first to the left, sharply left, and then just after to the right. And I keep doing the same, zigzag moves, taking a very curvy route, all the time.

After a sharp turn to the right, I set the autopilot, and I let the boat go on by the autopilot and do the job, even though it’s going to go just straight. Straight but full speed straight…

I take my backpack first, just in case, and I put it on my front, instead of putting it on my back. Then I go to the rear of the boat, as I saw something important there. And only a few long leaps, and I’m there.

Now, taking the scuba diving gears from the corner, wearing the tanks on my back, just in case… At the same time hearing how the bullets are hitting the rear and the main cabin of the boat. 

The constant firing, bullets breaking all the glasses of the boat one by one, the situation is getting more serious, very serious.

It’s only a matter of the time, apparently a very short time, when the boat gives up, or even blows up. There are lots of electrics, and just one bullet is needed to hit something essential, and to stop the boat.

Whoever these attackers are, they are here to kill me, that’s for sure. The coast guard would have done everything differently. They would have asked me to stay still, to identify myself, to surrender. But these guys are here to kill, only to kill.

The bullets are getting closer, too close, a row of constant fire now almost hitting me.

Suddenly the big rear doors are smashing down and I have to jump away from the rear, into the front of the main salon. Hiding now behind the bar desk, it giving me at least some cover, the bullets now riddling the whole thing, the roof, the walls, floor… the boat is getting completely destroyed. 

It’s a big boat, but apparently, they are going to shoot as long as the boat will give up. They have straight forward plan, to destroy the boat, and to kill me. They have only one purpose, and it’s to kill me.

When they’ll destroy the boat, when it will sink, there will be the end for me as well. Without the boat, being middle of the sea, middle of the night, many miles away from the coast, it’s pretty much guaranteed that I’ll be gone as well. 

It’s impossible to swim to the shore, for anyone, period. Even in a case I would survive the bullets, they can count on that, that anybody this far at the sea, far from the coast, will survive. It’s impossible to anyone, any normal humans.

They just have to make sure that they’ll get the whole lot, the boat, possible lifeboat, and that it’s all gone to the bottom of the sea, including me.

And they are doing their best I see, it’s pretty much all gone, already now.

At the moment I think so, the motors give up and stop from roaring. Maybe they hit the wires, or the motors, or both. But I can feel how the speed is slowing down, rapidly.

It’s only a matter of the time when they’ll hit the tanks, and then it will be a massive explosion. A couple of thousand of liters of fuel… It will be a massive explosion.

And, as realizing it, it’s time to go. But I must get goggles first and that’s why I jump into the rear of the boat, I grab the goggles, and I run towards to the rear deck of the boat.

And that’s when I see it coming, a rocket…

All odds are against me, practically now running through of the bullet rain, towards the rear edge of the yacht, I jump as far as I can, exactly at the moment when the rocket hits the boat.

Behind me, almost reaching my feet bottoms, is a huge explosion. At the same time, when the boat’s salon is being blown up, the explosion reaches the tanks, and…

It’s a massive explosion. The whole yacht jumps into the air, many meters high, and it’s all in small pieces in a moment it explodes. Sending a huge colorful fireball, the explosion is releasing enormous powers of the blast, tens of meters upwards, also now reaching me.

Now plunging through the water surface, a massive fireball of the explosion is wiping the water surface just above me. At the same time, the water is exploding too, a huge wave of the explosion whirling me with it.

Only thing I can realize is the explosion and me spinning, hurling among it.

And that I have to squeeze the belts of the gears, my backpack in front of me, and the flippers which I grabbed the last… now squeezing them all tightly against the backpack to avoid losing anything…















CHAPTER 20


I’m alive! 
It’s amazing, but I’m alive!

Now floating on my back, using the other scuba diving bottle as a buoy…

Already been here for many hours, hardly to say how many, but many…


After the explosion and the centrifuge of the waves of the blast, in some point, I managed to get the balance back. 

Being lucky, as I still had the gears on me, and as I managed to dive, have one long crucial dive... That saved my life.

I saw the lights of the helicopter swiping the water surface as they were looking for me. But I was diving further away from them and they were unable to find me.

I came to the surface, and I saw them, flying over the explosion site, making sure that it’s all gone. And it was all gone, the yacht was gone, completely destroyed, exploded into so small pieces, that there was hardly anything left floating on the surface. And if anything was left it sunk to the bottom of the sea…

After about 20 minutes of so, the helicopter left. And since that I have been floating.

I was lucky to manage to have all gears with me. The only thing on my mind was that I have to keep them, keep tight, as my life was depending on them.

And I’m lucky now, to have those life saviors with me, even thought there is absolutely zero guarantee of anything. I would say that anyone in this world would bet against me and my survival.

But, I have a different idea of that.

I have only one life and I want to keep it. I may just used one more cat-life, maybe it was sixth already now, but I have only one real life left. And that’s the only one I really want to have.

But now it’s all about survival, once again. And surviving from here means a long, long swim. Luckily, being a very good swimmer, long time ago competing in it, with some success, always been swimming, and diving. 

I must say that I’m the one, one of the most experienced in this. So my changes are the best. And as regarding to the fact, that I have actually been in this situation before, swum miles, long, terribly long miles…

I think I have a chance.

When it’s about survival, it’s the only thing on your mind, survival. When it’s about life threatening survival, that’s the only thing you can have on your mind, survival.

Yes, it’s all about survival. And that’s the only way to make it.

I know they are searching me, just in case, especially my friends. They are the ones with the hope that I somehow survived. And they are the ones, the only ones who would bet on me. They know that I have already used a significant amount of cat-lives in my past, and that I always want to keep my own.

The terrorists, or should I say, possibly some kind of terrorists… or whatever they are…

Anyway, they might be sure that they got me. The explosion was massive, and even if they saw me jumping, I was taken over by an enormous fireball. On their counts there is only one option, and that is that I’m gone.

Good for me I hope.

But, what comes to my chances, chances of survival, it’s time to start betting in favor of it. Even though, all the powers are gone and I’m death tired, deeply death tired, running only by some leftovers from the bottom of the additional emergency aid energy resources, I’m still on it.

And, I see the lights of the coast…

It’s the most beautiful view in the sunrise colored morning setting. At this time, seeing the coast, orange rising sun coloring it, slightly reflecting from the buildings… I must say that it’s the most beautiful sunrise I have ever seen in the world.

Only about five hundred meters left…
Only about three hundred meters left…
Only about hundred meters left…

My feet reach the soft sea bottom…

Heavenly sweet sand, my toes digging into it, trampling me slowly forwards, just about reaching the shoreline, finally there…

I have survived, once again. It’s amazing!

Now taking the scuba diving harness off, turning on my back, looking at the sun rising, gasping the fresh sea air, letting my muscles relax, being completely numb, the entire body about gone, but barely alive…

What would be more beautiful than that?

Being survived, the rising sun…
And a dog licking my face…

Thinking that in the movies it would pee on me, lifting a leg on some driftwood brought onshore by the sea. But luckily it’s just licking my face.

I must laugh at my own thoughts. At the same time, when going to greet the dog, I open my eyes. And, the biggest surprise ever, I see Rosa’s smiling face saying to me:

    • Welcome to Torrenueva!

She is bending down and helping me to sit up. I’m completely speechless, but luckily she takes care of speaking:

    • We saw the boat disappearing from the radar, and that the boat was gone.
    • We knew what had happened.
    • But we also knew that you’ll swim, as long as it takes.
    • We organized a few spotters along the coast within twenty-five kilometers.
    • And finally, one of the spotters saw you coming, slowly, but coming. 
    • And he alarmed me, so here I am.

She is smiling and now hugging me, saying:

    • So nice to see you!

She is now looking at my eyes, straight deep into my eyes, and says with the sweetest voice on earth:

    • I love you!

Her words send massive tsunami of warm waves through me, from my hearth through every spot in my body, and I say:

    • I love you too!

This amazing moment, the whole thing, being almost death, but survived, many times within a few days, surprisingly, her being my contact, she suddenly being here, and saying those magical words…

She is kissing me now, with one long, the sweetest kiss in the world…

It melts me…
I collapse… 

And I faint… 
I’m being knocked out.






















CHAPTER 21


    • It was a massive blow, I say.

She is smiling at me, driving, looking at me, and smiling at me. As looking at her, she is the most beautiful in the world. My heart bouncing, faster than in the hardest action, she looks at me and says:

    • Sorry about it.
    • I just said it, and it was the purest truth I have ever said.

I’m speechless. 

Everything what has happened in the last few days, it has been too much. And now this!

My brains are one of a hell of a mess…
The entire body feels like it’s all gone…

All the events, kind of dying, over and over again, once, twice, many times… the final destination reaching me, again, just after the last try about a few moments ago…

It’s too much I think.

When we first met, in our first ever mission together, we fell in love.

But it was the love destined to fail. In those missions, being in a life danger about all the time, there is very little space for such feelings like love.

And then our routes rifted apart, mine from hers, hers from mine, missions taking us all around the world, and also later on the life took us into the different directions.

She is now saying to me:

    • Somehow I felt it…
    • When I realized that it was you I also felt very strong feelings.
    • I think I always did.
    • And when you almost died, the worry scared me almost to the death as well.
    • And when I saw you lying on the beach, seeing you alive, I just said it.

She looks at me, and then the silence descends in to the car. I’m still speechless.

We are driving towards to Granada, as there are the others waiting for us. 

Her little black Mercedes SLK, convertible, with compressor. I know the car, very nice little car. It’s a two seater, only for two persons, and now a little dog on my lap.

There is lots of power in it compared to its size and light weight. It can reach up to 250 km an hour, go very fast, and it’s great joy to drive. It’s being one of the most compatible nice little cars in the world.

The roof is on now, and it’s silence in the car. Everything is so unbelievably unexpected. The whole thing is exceeding any understanding, and now this. It’s about impossible to reach to anything at all anymore…

That’s about my feeling at the moment.

We’re just about to come to Granada, when she takes the motorway junction leading towards to Malaga.

I’m looking at her and she says:

    • It’s only about 15 kilometers away.
    • You’ll see old friends there to welcome you back. 
    • It’s so nice to have you back.

Only what I can say is nodding at her. At first, but then my own ears can hear my own words coming out from my mouth, irresistibly, just like pouring out:

    • I love you too, you know it.

She is looking at me, the most beautiful face in the world, smiling, and saying:

    • Yes, I know it.
    • I always did.

But then, in the next most romantic moment on earth, after the one encountered on the beach less than an hour ago, there is an interruption, in front of us…

There are two or three police cars with the lights on, the policemen showing the signs to us to stop…

She looks at me, smiles, and then pushes the gas pedal, at first a little more, but then, I believe into the bottom. I can feel it.

The black Mercedes SLK convertible shoots forward its motor roaring. Only a few hundreds of meters, and we whiz by the policemen, sending them rush to their cars.

Even though they can hardly reach the same high-speed than this wonderful little rocket, but there are the others somewhere in front of us, that’s for sure.

And that’s how the second most romantic moment changes into a hardcore action. Now police cars accelerating behind us, we escaping from them, overtaking all the other cars, leaving them rapidly behind…

The motorway is leading to Malaga and I know the way. We’ll have tens of kilometers of steep downhill in front of us. It means that the minimum speed will be 250 km an hour. It means that most of the turns may be fatal in that speed. 

It also means that the car and the driver, both of them in a perfect cooperation, must make the best ever they can. 

And, also, it means that in some point, wherever the police will decide that they’ll try to stop us, it will be a very crucial moment.

Now, with the speed of 260 km an hour, the speed yet accelerating higher when the downhill gets steeper, driving faster than the Mercedes should even go. Now 265, still accelerating, hitting new records, 272 km an hour…

After a while there are two more police cars in front of us. The two cars are side by side, their clear purpose being to block our way, to get us slowing down. Now only a few hundreds of meters in front of us, then two hundred, then in a few seconds about a hundred, the cap between us and them now closing down in a seconds.

It looks like we are going to hit them, bang to the back of them, with a huge over-speeding, and that will be a massive crash, all cars bouncing all over the road, and over the steel reeling both sides of the road.

But, the Mercedes whizzes by the two police cars, straight through between the two cars, overtaking them almost in a blink of an eye. Now seeing an empty road in front of us, free go for now, but knowing that there will be more of them, possibly a hard crash.

Here in Spain the police do whatever they can to stop, and they can even shoot, use spikes, form the barricade, or… anything. But one thing is for sure it’s already waiting for us, in front of us, maybe just before we’ll come to Malaga.

Suddenly, there is a helicopter on the sky, moving with the same speed that we are. When I look at it, I can see big signs and it seem to be the news helicopter. And as thinking of it, there is maybe live broadcasting on the national news at the moment, possibly it being shared international.

But, as being so, it’s a big trouble for us…

I look at Rosa and ask:

    • What is that ProMotion Multimedia written on the doors of your car?

She keeps her focus on the road, but replies:

    • It’s my business.
    • I’m a photographer nowadays.

I laugh at and say:

    • You are having free and surely good advertising now. 
    • It’s all over the national news now, possibly worldwide…

She only replies with one word:

    • Shit!

Now already seeing Malaga down there, with magnificent sea views, the clouds in the sky disappearing, the sunny blue sky opening, our speed now being 283 km an hour…

It’s over 30 km an hour faster than the Mercedes should reach, too much would say. But to be honest, somehow, it feels great. I have had the widest smile on my face already for some time, and now I start laughing. It’s that adrenaline doped laugh again. Who got it, knows what it is…

Rosa is looking at me, possibly being a bit worried that something is wrong with me, but then smiling. I must say that she looks like enjoying of this particular moment, a lot, and for sure she is. It’s great to reach 283 km an hour with a little two-seater Mercedes convertible, which is supposed to go only about 250 as its maximum. So, well, let’s have some more fun…

But, just at the moment I think so, there appear to have many police cars in front of us, still about one kilometer away. Now wondering that what she is going to do next, the answer to that crucial question comes almost instantly.

She’s breaking, so hard that the ABS system is almost exploding, the car rattling, slowing down as fast as it can, the breaks burning, the disks turning to bright red.

There is a little hole in the steel railing, only about fifty meters away, some kind of dirt road service exit there, but it looking like the Mercedes is going to hit past the opening.

Suddenly, she releases the brakes, turns sharply to the right, and manages to get into the exit. But we have still over too much speed, so the car gets into a long slide, drifting now along the road edges. 

And there is the gate, closed gate, but she crashes straight through it, now the road straightening in front of us. She pushes the gas again, the Mercedes SLK speeding up, the gauge showing now 120 km an hour.

I would like to ask if she knows the road, a very narrow dirt road, as she scoots forward, the rear of the car drifting from the side to the other. A massive dust cloud behind us, rising towards the sky, the Mercedes is escaping it, with the style of a Rally Champion car.

I used to drive rally, and so used her to do racing, that’s what I know about her. That’s one common thing with us, racing, very rear but true. She was racing on asphalt, on the tracks, and me on the dirt roads. Both fascinated with high speed and close calls on the race, both of us with winning mode.

Pretty amazing I would say, but being just satisfied with the rough speed, admitting that she truly is good in this. Seeing her steering the car with a professional style…

It’s absolutely impossible that any police car would follow us. But it’s possible that there are more somewhere there, waiting for us. The police know where this road goes, and we’ll have to find a way out from here.

And the news helicopter, still on the shy following us, cameras filming, broadcasting it on the news, is going to be one of a big shit, just as she said.

But just as I’m thinking of it, she hits the brakes hard, the car sliding on the dirt road, its left side first. And stops 

As the thick dust cloud is reaching us, blooming all over us, covering up the helicopter on the sky, or rather us from it, she says:

    • Come, it’s your job now.

I open the seatbelt and the door, and I step out, now following her into the back of the car. She opens the trunk and slides away a cover, which I know is for separating the unfolded roof space and actual space for the belongings. I see a bag there, the black bag in a little trunk, filling about the whole little space. And she opens the bag.

She is pulling out a rifle, assembling it fast, the dust bloom still covering us entirely. Then she offers it to me and says:

    • You are the sniper here.
    • Do your job!

I laugh at her, but her face is looking so serious, that I just take the rifle, and say:

    • Okay, as you wish my sweetheart.

Then I take the position, standing shooting position, as the task is going to be easy. I let the dust bloom to settle a little, look through the scope, and when the helicopter appears to be seen, I shoot. At first once, and then once again, two sharp little knocks into the back rotor, causing a little malfunction there.

The helicopter is now starting to roll around as the back rotor is failing, and it starts to fall down. But as the fact is that the helicopters come neatly down as long as the main rotor is able to rotate, even in idling mode, it kind of braking the down the speed of falling, it’s going to be all okay for them, and they will land relatively smoothly.

Now following the helicopter’s way down, but just shortly, as Rosa says:

    • Thanks, well done!
    • It’s good to get rid of the news.
    • Let’s go!

At the same time she is slamming the back hood down. We both go back to the car, and even before I have properly sat down on the seat and closed the door, she already hits the gas onto the bottom.

The race continues.
















CHAPTER 22


    • What’s next? I ask.

We have been driving, or actually rally driving, through the endless dirt roads, lifting up a massive dust bloom behind us. 

We have come about 35 kilometers already, at first by her piloting. She was driving all the time as crazy… yes, I have to say crazy. That woman is much, much better driver than I knew. She is in a champion class, and that’s my honest opinion.

Then we changed after she had been enjoying these curvy roads about 25 kilometers. She suddenly stopped the car and said that it was enough for her, and that it was my turn.

But yes, rally driving is seriously hard job. It’s seriously dangerous, as in any moment, any second, the car can hit some rock or a bigger pump, and it can sling the car off from the road. And when it happens, the race has ended, that’s for sure.

Here, on these sharply curving rocky roads, the destiny can come across any moment. And here it’s dangerous, very, very dangerous. All around… there are only rocks everywhere. And in addition to that there are big rocks, size of a truck, or on the other hand canyons, tens of meters down.

The security barricades are only installed for the main roads, and the last one we saw, very close by, was when we exited from the motorway. Here, it’s all about rocks, and bigger rock, and on the other hand canyons.

The speed in these narrow dirt roads is normally from as slow as 25 to 50 km an hour as maximum, but it depends on who’s driving. But now our speed has been overly too high, from 40 to 200 km an hour. 

Yes, the car is still reaching up to 200 km, especially now when I’m driving. When there is a bit longer straight on, I’ll take everything I can from this little fancy Mercedes SLK, and we are flying.

Yes, practically, we are flying too. I love jumps and here it’s about constant. The longest jumps are from ten to fifteen meters. I have done much longer than that, but it was back then when driving the rally cars. Those cars are made for it and with them you can make big maneuvers.

This Mercedes is brilliant!

Even though it’s wrong-side driven, so called “English version”, which was a bit odd at first for a rally driving. But then when I got used to it I started to really enjoy of it. 

This little fancy car has got lot of power and it’s fast. It’s very light and the power in the motor is throwing the car almost as fast as you can make it here. It’s also about perfectly balanced and thus ideal for this. 

Yes, it is ideal for this, I love it!

I absolutely love it. And it makes me smiling.

I love rally driving and I used to do it a lot. And in this case “a lot” means full rough days, twelve hours a day and seven days a week. And as thinking of that time, I must say that it was just great, unbelievably great.

Rally driving is so adrenaline filling, especially when in a situation like this, so called wild rally driving, on the natural roads, unknown, dangerous, actually hazardous… On the roads which are unsecured, just normal roads. Here the danger is at its utmost.

And yes, I must admit, that’s exactly what I used to do. Driving on the normal roads, the best ever, even at night, for hours and hours, in a way exploring them through with the highest possible speed…

But, luckily, must say luckily, even though I destroyed bunch of cars, actually, honestly, a bit too many of them… I’m still alive. There were so many close-by calls, it all about being within milliseconds, so narrowly close. And it is truly unbelievable that anything worse than some bruises or slightly fractured bones ever happened.

With this current speed, in this environment, on these rocky roads, especially regarding to the sharp sudden cliffs and canyons just beside the road… Any moment can be last.

But, I’m well in control. 
At least I think I am...

And I got my crazy laugh, adrenaline doped laugh, one of the best laughs for a long time, just about a moment ago. It was so great, the highest speed you can ever reach here, sliding the car on the rocky road, along the canyon on the right side… It truly made me laugh.

But then, there was a command from the left side, a person sitting on a passenger’s seat, commanding that “slow down”.

And now, there comes another command:

    • Slow down!
    • You are enjoying it too much.

As commanded, I lift the gas pedal, but to be honest, just a very little. But then she adds:

    • I mean seriously, slow down.
    • It’s time to take it easy.
    • And there is a sharp turn to the right, just about five hundred meters ahead.
    • We’ll take it.
    • It’s also important that we stop making that massive dust track behind us, now.
    • So, slow down, now.

Okay, okay, I think, and I slow down.

Now, after about 20 minutes, looking from the mirrors, almost dust free track behind us, I’m driving only about 35 km an hour. And the speed, this low speed, feels like we are walking. Almost like would make it by walking faster. But that’s a very common delusion which sometimes comes straight after the high speed drive for a bit longer time.

Now she says:

    • There it is, to the right, take it.

I do what she says, and I ask:

    • Where are we going?

She looks straight on now and seems to be focused on something, a bit further on, maybe another junction, or a house. Then she says:

    • Right there, I see it.
    • Just follow the road and we’ll get there.
    • This is the right one.

I’m now a bit impatient and I ask again:

    • Where are we going?

She looks still ahead and says:

    • It’s a Finca, a house. 
    • Abandoned, mostly…
    • Been for decades, being the most remote place you can find.
    • But we’ll have some supplies there, and we’ll change the car.
    • It’s a safe-house.
    • We can stay overnight, but let’s see.

Aah, I understand, that’s exactly what we need now, I think.

Now following the road slowly, carefully preventing from making any dust behind us, just in case there is a search helicopter looking for us, or someone around somewhere on the mountain hills.

We come to the gate, and I have to stop. She goes to open it, and I drive in. Then she closes the gate. And wen she sits down back on his seat she says:

    • The house is about a kilometer from here, just follow the road.
    • A friend owns the place, all what you can see around. 

Yep, it’s always “A Friend”, I think.

Now following the road, a very narrow road, right about one kilometer, and we are arriving into the large yard of a rocky house.

It looks definitely like abandoned. And to be honest, it looks like it has been abandoned maybe about hundred years ago. For sure it is “the most remote place” in Europe and it’s been so for a long, long time. I must ask here, a bit jokingly:

    • It looks like it has been abandoned decades ago, or maybe a couple of centuries, seriously…?
    • Are you sure that there are “some supplies” here?
    • Do we really need “that” remote place?

When I stop the car and switch off the engine, she opens the door and says:

    • There is everything we need, definitely.
    • The place is hundreds of years old, and even though it looks like it looks, there is absolutely everything we need.
    • Water, electricity, food, shower… and another car back there.
    • There is a big garage.
    • I know it, trust me.
    • I’ll show you later.

As looking at the house and its surrounding, dry rocky landscape, just rocks everywhere, some very dry bushes… rocky hills all around the place. It’s looking like a deserted place in an old western movie, I say:

    • It looks like there are only spiders and bugs there, maybe even scorpions and snakes, or skeletons...
    • There might be many lives taken and bodies buried here.
    • Are you sure that this is the right place?

She only nods and goes a few meters away, turning a little one rock, and comes back with the key. Yep, now I believe that she got the right place I think. I ask her:

    • How do you know this place?
    • Have you been here before?

She opens the doors and replies:

    • Yep, I have brought supplies here and I know this place very well.
    • Been here a few times.

Okay, I think. Now she opens very old wooden shutters letting some light in. And indeed, when now looking at the house inside, I must say that inside looks actually good. It’s cozy, nice and tidy. She points out a doorway with her finger and says:

    • Go back there and you’ll find a generator, so start it.
    • There are big batteries as well and we’ll have to recharge them anyway.
    • I switch the electricity on.

At the same time when giving me new commands she goes to a room on the left side from the entrance. At the same time I’m going towards the door in the back of the large entrance salon, and I open the door. And only a little moment after the light pulp hanging from the roof in the middle of the room comes on, giving a dim light.

The batteries I think. Then I see another door, and I open it. I’ll come to the little utility space which is actually kind of an outside space. And I find the generator.

When I’ve got the generator on I go back to the saloon, and I see her taking something from the cupboards. I ask her:

    • So, what are we doing now?

She has got some food cans on her hands, putting them on the desk, now switching on the gas stove, replying:

    • Have a seat and take it easy.
    • At first I’ll cook something to eat for us, and then we’ll see.
    • We’ll have to contact to the center.
    • They are wondering that what has happened as we were supposed to go to meet them in Granada.
    • But possibly they have seen us in the news anyway, so they may suppose that I’ll bring us here.
    • But we’ll have to confirm it and get some orders that what to do next.

Yep, I know the procedure. 

Now sitting down, thinking, that this has been such a massive blow into my peaceful retirement. All of a sudden, running from the death to death, so yes, for sure, maybe it’s time to take it easy for a little while. Wait for a little while and then eat, properly.

But will see how long that easy ride will continue, I think…


























CHAPTER 23


It’s a weird feeling…

Now sitting on the chair next to the table, eating, taking it easy, also relaxing…

But all the time thinking that what’s next?
Where it comes from, the next attack?

And even though, I have a huge confidence that whatever it is, I will solve the thing…
It’s all the time on, the pressure, preparedness, ears ready to spot any differentiating noise or the smallest sign of anything…

That’s what it is, being under the constant pressure, in a situation like that, action, tense present, all the time on alertness.

But, that’s what it is. And I’m used to it. It’s my profession to manage it. Or, actually, it was my profession before I quit, and retired.

Now, when suddenly forcefully pulled back to the service, even though very unofficially now, most of those “things”, certain vide range hardcore abilities” are taking place, being to come back as an automated behavior. It’s all familiar mind-setting from the past, and in a way it feels good to be back.

The “thing” is getting normal again.

But this time it’s different. I was retired, fully retired, forgotten all that, the whole thing, emptied my mind and memory. I was being relaxed, enjoying the free time, permanent freeway, holidaying… 

But, then, being fully innocent bystander, I was dragged back to the “thing”… And sudden action, instinctive reaction, took place. And everything happened, so unbelievably sudden, automatically, without me being actually in charge of anything much… 

And then more and more followed, I took it all in a rush of survival, high-speed escape for the next… “shit”.

Yep, that’s what it is, “shitty thing” to be honest. It’s one of a hell of a big shit!

But now, being here, contacted to the “guys”, being “picked up”, then “taken in” and now “back in service”… even though in practice, forcefully… Yeah, in a way it’s great.

Funny thing, but when being here now, even though it has been unbelievably rough rocky route the get here, I’m feeling calm. Despite of the fact that there is a constant threat, constant danger, constant possibility that the next attack comes in any moment, sudden change, possibly blowing up the whole thing into a full action again.

Yep, it’s about being calm. There is a certain calmness which takes place, and all those kind of normal feelings have disappeared. It’s what being in action is. You stay focused, with well experienced calmness, and you are ready all the time. It’s part of the business, risky business. Any moment can be the last.

But, even though all the facts are harsh, deathly harsh, you are relaxing, joking, even enjoying and having fun. You mind is calm, in a kind of trance, in the situation of transaction. It’s your business and you do what you have to do.

So, now, when eating Rosa’s wonderful cooking, magically created form the canned food, looking at her on the other side of the table, a stunning beautiful woman, eating without any hurry, or worry…

I must say, it’s great to be back!

I’m looking at her. She is the “one in charge” here, still being in ranks, part of the command chain. And as I’m just a bystander here, I’m asking from her:

    • What’s next?
    • Should we make a contact?
    • And what is the plan?

At first she is quiet, finishing her portion, but then after a few minutes she replies:

    • Yep, that’s what we’ll do next.
    • We’ll use the satellite phone, as it is secured, coded, and impossible to them to break.
    • So, let’s see what they have got.

She takes the phone, pushes the button, only one and only one time, the dial button, and waits a little while.

She pushes another button, a speaker at this time that I can hear everything too, and in about ten seconds someone answers:

    • How’s it doing?

She smiles and answers:

    • Great, just got food, being satisfied, and now waiting for introduction.
    • Do you have a plan?
    • At least you have had time while we have been trying to save our skin.

The man’s voice on the phone is quiet for a moment, but then it says:

    • Yes, we have some information, and we have a plan.
    • Good or bad news first?

I laugh at his “cliché”. And Rosa replies:

    • Give bad first.

The man’s voice says:

    • Okay, here the best part of it…
    • They are some mercenaries, terrorists of course, but mercenaries.
    • And they seem to have almost unlimited resources and the best ability to track down almost anything, and to attack rapidly anywhere they like.
    • And they have serious firepower, apparently lots on men, about everywhere in Spain, and obviously in the world.
    • It seems that there is some massive secret mission ongoing there.
    • And the fact is that we are completely out, unable to know who they are, where they come from, what are their plans… or almost anything at all.
    • So practically, we are the ones running in the darkness, and it’s just a guessing game on our part.
    • To be honest, we have a losing hand here, and they have all the best cards.

Rosa says to the phone:

    • Wow, that’s a hell of a lot of bad news.
    • And how about the good news?

There is a little pause on the other end of the line, but then the man answers:

    • Well, we got the best bite in the game.

    • Oh, great, I say, interrupting.

It just comes out from my mouth when realizing that all what they got is a bite, human flesh, and that’s my flesh that…

And, on top of that, Rosa says:

    • Okay, how will we use it?
    • What’s the plan?

That’s cool, I mean bloody cold, I think.
Even though understanding the situation, but?

They are squeezing me into a hook, punching it through my body, just like a piece of bite for fishing, for a big fish...

And she is ready to use me as a bite, to be killed once again? So, what is that I would ask…? Love perhaps?

But, that’s what it is. It’s the reality here, I’m the best bite. And even though it’s far from normal to use one of your own as bite, it actually happens all the time.

Actually, all of the persons on the field are in a way bites for an opponent, and it’s just about that who is in what role, and that how will you handle the situations when confronting the foe. Who comes out as a winner.

So, here we are. And I ask before Rosa does:

    • So, what’s the plan?
    • How will we do it?

The man replies now instantly:

    • We’ll contact you a bit later.
    • Have a rest and recover your powers, you’ll need them.
    • Get ready, check the car, take up some small sized weapons, a lot of magazines… and be ready.
    • I think you’ll leave tomorrow morning, so rest well, but be ready.
    • It’s gonna be a long day tomorrow.

Rosa replies:

    • All clear, we’ll prepare, be ready.

And she adds smiling:

    • And we’ll rest properly.

Then the she shuts down the connection.

We are looking at each other with Rosa. At first with serious faces, but only for a little moment, and then we start laughing. And just after the first heartwarming unavoidable burst of laughs she says:

    • And was that the “good” news?
    • Did I miss something?




























CHAPTER 24


We are opening the garage doors.

The building looks small from outside. But when opening the doors I realize that it’s actually big. In the middle of the hardest desert, only the rocky hills and heaps around this place, absolutely everywhere, in a way everything manmade looks tiny small.

And as thinking of it, within tens of kilometers of radius, this place is maybe the only one, the only human habitation, so yes, relatively, it is as little as anything can be.

I say and ask:

    • Wow!
    • Which you like more, a 4x4 or a van?
    • Which are we going to take?

There are two options in the garage, an old small 4x4 Mitsubishi Pajero, and a very old looking Mercedes 508 van, big van, kind of a green army van.

I know them both as I have had one of each in the past. Both are good on its particular ways. Both are very good options for certain things, and it’s just depends on what is the need, for what are you going to use it.

In a case we’ll have to escape from here, over the desert and mountainous landscape, go off-road, drive past the pathless paths, the Pajero is best for that.

In a case we’ll have time, we possibly have to camp on the way, wherever it takes us, or we need some additional resources with us, the van is absolutely the best.

And common with both cars is that they have got the simplest technical characteristics, old, with total lack of additional electronics, or anything which can fail anytime. And the fact that about everything in these cars can be fixed on the road, makes them maybe the most reliable survival type of vehicles. And they can be stored for years still always working anytime when needed…

So, yeah, very good choices I must say.

Rosa is already checking the van, opening the driver’s door and stepping in. She takes the key from below the dashboard, opens the motor cover which is in the middle of the driver’s cabin, connects the battery cable looking like mechanic, pushes the gas pedal in to the bottom a few times, and turns the key…

The motor is trying, but she needs another try, and then the motor starts, at first a bit hesitantly, but now running steadily. 

Oh I like the sound of it I think, so familiar.

Then Rosa looks at me, smiles, and says:

    • What are you waiting for?
    • Kick the wheels, let’s go.

I do what she says, going to go to do it. But she laughs at me and says:

    • I was kidding…
    • I’ll get this out, drive the Mercedes in and then close the door.

Okay, I admit, I was actually going to “kick the wheels” as I thought that she wants me to check them. But now, when looking at the wheels when she is driving the van out, I can see them all being fine.

Next I drive the SLK in to the garage, and disconnect the battery cable. And then as commanded, I close the doors. at the same time when she drives the van into the front of the front door, and stops there letting the motor run, warming it up. And when the garage door is well locked, looking as abandoned as it was, even with the rusted iron scrap put back in its place in front of the door, I’m going to there as well.

We put our backpacks in, me having still the one I robbed from the terrorists, or whatever mercenaries they are, and she throwing in hers. Then we’ll shut down the place, close the doors of the house, make sure that everything is exactly like it was, with double check one detail at the time.

And then we’ll jump into the van, she on the driver’s seat, and me onto the passenger’s. The doggy takes the place in the middle on the top of the motor’s cover. Slamming the doors closed, she putting on the first gear, going to go.

I lift my feet on the top of the dashboard, take the most comfortable position possible, at the same time when she starts driving a very narrow rocky road. Then I ask:

    • Why did you choose this van?

Her reply is short:

    • I like it.

While she is driving, I start thinking…
And I’m actually feeling tired, very…
It has been so unbelievably tiresome…
She promised to the man in a command center that we’ll rest, have a proper rest…

But I must say that the night was gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous, but far from rest.

And even though I would have needed a good rest and recovery, seriously, I must say that I’m completely okay with it.

Then some more serious thoughts are pouring into my mind. In addition to that what has already happened, I’m also pondering the option is that what is going to happen. And I start thinking of the orders which we got when the center contacted us last night.

It was actually very simple…

We’ll have to go to Malaga. 
We’ll have to “reveal” ourselves by making unsecured connection.
We’ll also “reveal” that we’ll go to the port of Malaga, to the certain “meeting” point.

And then we’ll hope the best…

It’s morning, so we have enough time to get there. The “meeting” in the harbor is going to be at 2am at night. They have chosen it to happen after midnight, 02.00 being a zero point, the most crucial moment when the “last man standing” events are going to start.

The most unpredictable factor will be that how much men and firepower the enemy, the mercenaries are going to deploy there. And of course, that will they “bite the bite”.

Until then, it’s going to be easy, I hope.

And now, when looking at Rosa, remembering the last night, the night of “maximal relaxation” I ask her:

    • Where next?
    • Where are we going to go?
    • It’s 8am at the moment, so we’ve got a lot of time, about 18 hours.

She seems to have a plan I see as she replies:

    • Let’s go to have a proper dinner, big beefs at Plaza Mayor. 
    • Do you still remember the last time?

And she is smiling at me, looking like she told the best joke ever.

    • Yes, I do, I say.

And as thinking of it now, for sure I do…

I well do. And the last time we went there, was a very similar to this. We were “kind of” on a mission, being prepared to be deployed any time, but just spending the time together and enjoying a little holiday, just a few days offline, before the next task. 

We fell in love back then, or I think we did. At least a lot of things between us happened, even though shortly, in a way momentarily, but there was a strong bond between us, thin bond but strong.

It felt like a beginning of something great back then, and it was a common feeling between the two of us. We were even talking about withdrawing from the missions, just as that’s what often happens when someone finds “a real thing” in their life.

And it was almost going to happen to us too, well considered, pulling out, retiring, figuring out something else to do in our lives, something else than putting it in to a serious risk about all the time. 

And we were already considering it, our thoughts and feelings running the routes of love, something else than brains leading its way, irrationally, crazy plans of having children, and all that normal life… “thing”.

And yes, honestly, we were going to go to the restaurant at Plaza Mayor, in the great shopping center in Malaga, one of the biggest and the newest back then.

We were going to enjoy a meal, proper big beefs, in one of the best restaurants, in a wonderful Spanish Hacienda style shopping center, the whole place truly fitting well into our taste. And it was going to be one of the greatest nights in our lives. But…

The last time was far from having a dinner, but indeed, it was a kind of a “big beef thing”, I would say so. At least it was a life-changing momentum in our lives.

Back then, the meat which got bloody hammered, well grilled and seriously burned, was our meat, literally. It was our skin and our life which got turned upside down.

We got ambushed there, all coming “from the bushes”, suddenly, unexpected, at the time when we were flying on the top of the highest point in our future expectations. 

We got attacked, both shot at, and that was one of the closest calls of all times. And even though we both survived, we had to escape, only managing to do so, very narrowly.

And, actually, that is the last moment together between us. We were pulled apart from each others, violently, a hardcore reality crushing all the rosy dreams we had emerged…

Yes, that’s when we have last seen, and since that it has taken long, long time. We have been running through different paths, until the very special moment, only a day ago, those paths came back together, at the beach.

As remembering, something liking my face after I had stranded from a very long swim, I look at the little dog, now standing on the motor’s cover, pads on the dashboard. A smart little Pomeranian is observing the road, ears up and alert. 

The dog looks so sharp that I would imagine him driving the van. 

I’m petting him, and say:

    • Yes, I do remember.
    • It was a rough beef back then.
    • Hope it is different now.

Yes, indeed, I hope that the thing will go by the plan, and that the trap we’ll set to the terrorists, or whatever mercenaries they are, will be a great success.

But at the same time knowing, that in these “things” it rarely happens to happen by the plan, unexpected factors leading the way, I ask a question which comes to my mind, still petting a little dog:

    • Where are you going to put him?

She smiles and replies:

    • He’ll wait in the van.
    • I’ll be back.























CHAPTER 25


Great!

But, it’s funny thing, getting into this spot here now, was actually very exciting.

Now when starting, my adrenaline level is already high, I’m feeling warm, like something is warming me up. The heart’s pumping rate is accelerated a little, my toes… yes, at this time toes, are tensed… And the mind is excited.

Yep, I’m starting…

The beef I got in front of me is amazing. It’s big, well done, properly grilled… Looking like the perfect fulfillment for me. I have been waiting for this beef here for a long, long time. I’ve been hoping for this happening… since the whole thing last failed.

I have the best ever company, now taking the first bit of her beef. We are smiling, looking at each other as putting the piece of meat into the mouth, both at the same time.

It makes us laughing. We are still looking at each other now cutting the next piece. And for sure, anyone seeing us would thing that we have just fallen in love.

To be honest, coming here, was the most ever exciting go ever into the restaurant. We were both so excited that we were laughing at it and ridiculing ourselves.

At the same time when she is giving a little piece of meat for the doggie, I’m thinking of arriving here. In practice, somehow as challenging the destiny, we did all exactly in the same way than the last time. The time which ended into a chaos, shootout, rifting apart from each other, and finally into a longtime separation… too long time…

So, now, we parked the van into exactly the same spot. In a parking area where the large passenger planes, are landing to the Malaga’s airport, descending only a few tens of meters above you.

We waited until the next plane came, approaching, coming closer, and finally passing by very close above us, so close that it almost looks dangerous. Yes, of course, it’s completely harmless and safe, but they come very close, anyway.

And then when we were walking into the restaurant, into the very same restaurant we were going to go last time. We were expecting something to happen, attackers to appear and the same horrible things to happen.

But at this time, we were able to reach the restaurant, able to order the portion we wanted to have last time… And this time we also got the portion. And now, it’s maybe the sweetest and the most peaceful moment here, being very precious between us, ever. And the whole thing, excitement, makes us laugh.

Eating big beefs at the terrace, still laughing, when putting the third piece of meat into the mouth, again at the same time, looking at each other, smiling…

There is a sudden gunfire burst towards us. And the best I can shout out loud is:

“Shit!”

Someone is attacking us, firing with the machine guns, and the second thing I say is:

“Again?”

At the same time when scooting onto the floor, I see how Rosa does the same. She grabs the dog and jumps down to the floor, a few meters away from me. I grab the handgun under my belt, instinctively, and only a few seconds later I’m already responding to the gunfire.

With the first three bullets I hit one attacker riding on a motocross bike, and he falls down the bike continuing its way towards us. But it crashes against the chairs and tables, stopping there about ten meters from us.

This is crazy, I think. They are attacking in the broad daylight, lots of people around, walking, eating, just enjoying…. And the attackers are putting everybody here into a life danger. There are tens of the people in this and the closest restaurants. Children, women, men… all are in a serious life threatening danger now.

But when realizing that it might be actually what the mercenaries are doing on purpose, a case of another “terrorist attack”... And that they are possibly also targeting the people as well as us. And even though their primary target is to kill me, their idea, possibly, is to kill many others too… 

So, I think, that I’ll have to do something.

It’s a massive chaos here, the people running and trying to find cover, trying to find some safe spot, or just trying to run away. Horrible screaming, 

Being unable to spot all the attackers, to even know how many they are, to make quick plans to react and respond, I yell to Rosa:

    • I’ll have to get the bike and lead them away from here!
    • Cover me up as well as you can!
    • I must go!

And just a second after I have said what I said, I think about the fact, that the last time, the exact words were the last I said her.

And as the consequences, all what then happened afterwards… It changed our lives, completely, I’ll crawl to her, despite the danger and the bullets hitting close. I give her a kiss and I say:

    • We’ll see again, I promise.
    • Come to the port if you can…
    • I’ll find you anyway.

I kiss her again, look at her, and say:

    • Cover me, I’ll get the bike.

Then I go. Shooting and running at the same time, towards the motocross bike, I see how another attacker falls off from his bike. He falls into the ground and rolls over, but starts getting up straight away.

When he’s just about going to shoot me, I snap three bullets to him, one in the head and two in his chest. At the same time still running, I’m reaching the bike.

I lift it up, noticing that the motor still running. I jump on it and turn the gas on full. The bike jumps forward, the back wheel skidding, now rifting. I’m now getting away, hoping that the attackers are following me as I’m their primary target anyway, and hoping that the people will be saved.

And yes, they are, indeed, except one. At the same time when heading off from the plaza of the Plaza Mayor, through the row of restaurants, dodging the tables and chairs. I peek backwards and I see two attackers on their bikes behind me, crashing through the restaurants too, shooting almost all the time.

When I look at the restaurant where we were enjoying the beefs, just one last quick blink to there, I see one attacker being hit by the bullet from Rosa’s gun, the attacker swinging backwards and falling down. Well done I think, being sure that Rosa will finish him, just to prevent any additional chaos and damages, to end the terrorist attack.

Now heading off through the walkways, with the highest speed I can ride with the bike, two or three attackers following me… Riding the bike through the corridors, passing by a huge movie center… 

The one I’ve been to before and the one where we were going to go after the dinner. To watch perhaps some romantic movie, to have something different than the everyday action life we were living in.

Now heading off away from the center…

At the same time when trying to find the least crowded passage out from here, I’m thinking of how we made an unsecured connection with the center, about two hours ago, as it was by the plan. And as thinking of the fact that the attackers came so fast after us, and that they are seemingly prepared to do everything they can to kill me… It’s astounding.

The ability they can act, terrifying brutality… and the disregard to anyone’s safety, towards the innocent people, that truly is stunningly astounding.

But, on the other hand, they truly are the terrorists. They are the worst ever kind of criminals. Being mercenaries and doing all that what they are doing, being obviously paid by some instances, is as bad as the terrorism, blatant terrorism.

They are terrorists, paid terrorists! But their motive is the money instead of ideology or religion. Or it’s something else. Maybe they are serving somebody, something… something which is utterly rotten, criminal. And whatever it is, it’s the worst of a kind in the humanity, in the world.

Just right now I’m already outside and driving away from the Plaza Mayor, heading towards the exit from the car park area, and I notice at least two black minivans waiting for me there. They are blocking the way out.

And also, I see that there is shooting on the parking area as well, for some reason, maybe to cause maximal chaos there too. And if that’s part of the attacker’s plan, it definitely works very well.

There is a massive chaos everywhere.

It makes me mad, wanting to kill them all. And it makes me so mad that I pull another gun from the holder, and I drive straight towards the two vans. I start shooting at them with both guns, one in each hand, continuously, with steady space.

I know what I do, now riding both hands off the steering rod, shooting. I know what I do in all that what comes to shooting, and I’m also hitting the target I’m aiming at.

I see the windscreen smashing, one attacker being hit into the chest, and a few seconds after another into the head. Two down sends two others of them looking for cover behind the opened doors, but the rest are shooting at me in standing position.

And as I’m shooting, I recognize the model of the vans being exactly the same which I used to have in America, in Florida when being there. And amazingly, at the same time as being able to feel sorry for the cars, the Dodge minivan model which I like a lot, I keep shooting and breaking them with the bullets, glasses smashing.

But my purpose to pull their gunfire towards myself to save the lives of the innocent people, works very well. Only problem is that their bullets come over too close, now a couple of them peppering the front of the bike with nasty blink sounds.

It being sure that they’ll hit me too, it being only a matter of seconds, so I put the guns back under my belt. Now willing to get away, alive, I take a firm grip of the steering rod, and I turn to the left, now heading off from the road, towards the bushes.

I’m crashing through the bushes, jumping with the bike a long leap, touching the ground again, and dodging the attacker’s vans with the highest speed possible, only about thirty meters from them.

They are shooting at me all the time, kind of following my route with the constant fire, some bullets blinking to the bike, one scratching my leg… But I’m getting away.























CHAPTER 26


I’ll come back to the road and turn the gas full, now accelerating fast. I look at backwards and I see them rushing into the cars. And immediately, they start turning them, obviously to follow me.

But the two vans are already a bit further back there, and the biggest threats are the two attackers on their motocross bikes behind me. They are now focusing on driving, trying to get closer to me. But I’ve got a different idea, thinking, that I must get rid of them.

And, maybe the best way, is to test their driving skills. And I know where to run the test… 

Only a couple of kilometers by the road, and we reach it. Driving with the highest speed I take a narrow dirt path, now heading off towards an old big Spanish horse ranch, then soon turning towards the wetland. It’s a huge reedy and muddy area, full of tall bulrushes and canes. And that’s going to be the place to test their driving skills.

But when driving through the bulrushes, the muddy water splashing around and jetting behind me, I’ll reach more and more distance between us. Now realizing that the test is a success for me, but a failure for them, now thinking that it might be a crucial failure for them this time…

And when I look behind me, realizing that they are about hundred meters away from me, and that in a certain spots and sharp turns I’m disappearing from their sight…

I hit the brakes and stop, turn on my seat, wait for a few seconds… And when the first one of them appears on my sight I shoot at him smashing his visor, putting two bullets into his head. It’s only a few seconds later and he falls down, flying backwards by the force of the bullets, his bike still riding on itself, straight towards me.

But the other one is quick enough to dodge my bullets, by turning straight into the bulrushes. At first I think that should I go after him, find him, and kill him too, but then realizing that it’s the best to go.

Now turning the gas fully on, heading towards the road, then running a short way across the asphalt, straight into a big parking area full of the campers, and cars…

The parking area is completely full of the cars, and as realizing that the beach is full of the people of course, I must change my plan.

I was going to go to the beach, and ride along it towards to Malaga, then after about a kilometer, ride alongside the river, back to the road, heading off towards the port.

I know the area very well as I have been around here a lot in my past, for months, several times. It was so called “free-camping” period here, on the big car park with a small camping van, similar to that old Mercedes we found from the garage, but blue. Back then I was just relaxing, being on a well earned rest, waiting for the next mission, and being ready to get back into action, anytime.

But, as there are too much people there now, the long beach being completely full, people everywhere here… that’s why I must change the plan.

And now, speeding up at the highest the bike can do, straight towards the two black Dodge minivans, I’ll play the dearest game.

I must get into the port, as the plan was to have it as the final battleground. But the two vans are driving towards me, front of me, side by side, their obvious idea being to smash straight against me with the fastest speed.

We are playing the Russian Roulette now, I see, and I’m the one who got the worst cards I know. But, I must get onto the motorway leading to Malaga, it being the only option to get over the river.

So, I turn the gas fully on, straight towards the front lights of the two Dodge minivans.

But just about in a moment we are going to hit, me on the bike to smash against the front of the black Dodge, I turn sharply right and avoid the deathly collision.

Now heading off towards to the Golf Resort, riding through the golf courts, with the highest speed possible, two vans following me… Thinking, that for sure, this race maneuver is making the owner mad, crazily mad, when they see us destroying the perfect neat grass…

What has to be done has to be done, I think.

The bike being better here I’m actually gaining some distance to the vans. And as being so I have the best ever chance to get back to the road, to have cap enough to be able to avoid them from catching me on the motorway. There the Dodge vans with 350 horsepower motors are surely faster than the motocross bike, but the cap in between us now is my advantage.

And that’s why I’m now heading off from the golf resort. Next driving again by the asphalt road, then taking the exit into the motorway, ramp up with the gas on the bottom, straight on towards the Malaga…

Now dodging through the traffic, avoiding from hitting the cars, I’m actually gaining the distance to the vans. There are too many cars blocking them. But my gain is only a little, too little to be safe, but at least it’s useless to them even to try to shoot me. And as thinking about that I’m actually thinking of the innocent people instead of my own skin.

Only about a few kilometers and I’ll reach the straight road leading to a huge port area. The area is massive, I’ve been there before. I know exactly where to go and what ship to get into, but at first I’ll have to manage to do so.

I’m just taking the exit away from the motorway. The two vans are now a fit further back there, both vans still following me, but having a safe distance between us now. It was actually lucky for me that the motorway was so full of the cars and actually almost jammed, as it helped to get away from the attackers.

Now, still riding with the fullest speed, forcing the bike to do its best, heading off along the shoreline road, a very wide long straight road now ahead of me… There is another nasty, but well expected surprise there.

Just as I was thinking of my changes being actually good, there appears a new player in this came. I see a few police cars coming towards me, along the wide road.

But, as the road is so wide, and I’m riding the bike, it’s easy for me to dodge them. And another big difference is that the police is avoiding from causing any crashes and accidents, or actually killing me. 

They have completely different rules and different orders, obviously. Their handbook rather tells them to follow instead of even trying to stop by the force the speeders. And that makes the task to get away from them easy for me now. 

But obviously, they turn and start following me, now speeding up fast.

Only a kilometer more and I have maybe five police cars behind me, plus two Dodge vans full of terrorists of course.

But what is the plan now? 

Am I going to lead the whole gang, line of the cars, tens of the policemen, along with the terrorists to the port area?

And what happens then?

We’ll see I think, soon reaching the port area.

















CHAPTER 27


This has been an amazing journey I must say.

While driving on, the police and the terrorists behind me, chasing, trying to stop me, catch me and… Yep, right, the police may be my savior but those guys will kill me hundred percent sure.

The latest events, the things are flashing on my mind, in a form of some kind of memory flash recollection of the… Unbelievable!

At first the attack at the La Mata beach…

Their clear intention was to cause the most horrific terrorist attack, bloody massacre with at least tens of casualties, on the beach, the one full of people, thousands of holidaymakers, in the most beautiful day on earth.

Then I got involved. There was a machine gun shootout, but I survived, and killed four terrorists, one with bare hands, and three with an instant death sentence middle of their forehead, one per each.

Then, I saw one man more, I followed him, found out that there were more of them…

And I ended up killing them all, four more terrorists, but now practically about dying myself too. But, it was “the last chance” fake. And I survived once again. Then being a celebrated hero, given a new-birth name by the public, the “Matador”…

Then an escape, spending “quality time”, as camping for long hours in sudden hideout in the sewer tube. Then, the run through La Mata Park, refreshing bath, run along the rocky route, bushy and scratchy climbing to the Masa hotel, in where I have had been staying for some time… 

Rough night healing my multiple wounds, and especially the gun shot hole through my hip. Horrific dream, waking up, straight into the hardcore reality…

Hideout in the abandoned Eden Roc hotel, some rest with some supplies, but the terrorists finding me, and attacking with heavy force. Deathly shootout again, grenades, explosions, many of them dying...

Escape, again, by the air now, flying, or actually almost free falling with the wind surfing kite, smashing into the sea. Sinking, practically just about dying again.

But then, a miracle, somehow surviving, once again, but very, very narrowly…

Long swim and the rocky route run through Torrevieja’s coastline, to the Marina Salinas. Hideout, catch up, as the police found me. 

Powerboat escape, with a real big power yacht, causing little tsunami and a chaos again, crashing through the police barricade and the boat they had used for blocking my way out from the harbor. Speedy ride with the speedy yacht straight on towards to Italy. But finally turning and heading off to the south, towards Africa at this time.

A bit later, the terrorists finding me again, attacking from the air by the helicopter, shooting, crazy shooting with a heavy machine gun. Then firing missiles, a massive explosion, the yacht being destroyed, back into the smallest pieces you can have it.

Then the longest swim in my long history of the crazy things in the past, and now in the present, as forcefully drawn back into action, again, from my well deserved, permanent and enjoyable, mission of retirement…

Then, the sweetest ever wakeup call, by a dog… and the most beautiful and desired woman in the world. But having a love framed duty call, unofficially official, back in, back to the ranks.

And the following was the sweetest ever rally race experience in my crazy driver’s past life.

Only the fact that we had to escape the police cars, exceeding the limits of the Mercedes SLK, with 283 km high speed, down by the mountain motorway... Plus the fact that I had shoot down the news helicopter.

Just to recollect a couple of little disturbing facts in the sweetest ever drive.

But as always, the heroes will be rewarded, this time as well... With the most ever sport-active night sleep in a human history, history of mine, in the most memorable ways.

Then nice and peaceful but mountainous drive with an old Mercedes 508 survival style “army” van, green, having a good camouflage. 

Ending up to Malaga, to the Plaza Mayor to recollect some unforgettable memories, having the best ever beefs… Or actually, just a few bits of them.

Sudden shootout, machine guns bursting out the bullets again, the terrorist appearing with the motocross bikes trying to kill us… Managing to kill a few of them, pulling the rest behind me, having companied by the multiple police cars…

And here I am… 

Squeezing the gas at its toppest, reaching the highest speed ever reached by the bike on a fancy coastline boulevard, next to the greatest beaches in Malaga, heading off towards to the harbor, a huge Malaga port area.

So, with these memory flashes on my mind, at the same time trying to figure out, brains burning, that “what a fuck I can do?”

The command given was to lead the terrorists into the harbor, to conduct a couple of maneuvers there, finally trapping so called “terrorists”, a bunch of mercenaries, at least some of them alive at this time.

Clear orders I admit, but the fact is that I’m well ahead of the schedule given. I was supposed to go to the port in peace, at nighttime, after the midnight, without any rush or people in danger around… And then end up into the planned point where the “guys”, our own guys are waiting for us.

But the whole brilliant plan was blown up into the bullshit category by an “unexpected factor” taking the place in action, once again. As the fact apparently being, that I’m the only one, a lonely wolf, “our guy” here now... Obviously, without any backup, and help…

So, as being here, well too early now, just about arriving to the port area, luckily noticing an opening gate, swishing in through a narrow cap, the police and the terrorists apparently following me… 

The question remains, pouring out loud from my mouth:

    • What a fuck I can do?













CHAPTER 28


I know the place very well, meaning the entire port area. I’ve got a photographic memory, and the satellite pictures which I have been examining, are on my mind, in as clear pictures as they were. I can see each of them, the whole area as one.

But the difference with the satellite pictures is that they are still, completely immobile, taken a little while ago. And that now, the situation is high-speed in everything.

Now accelerating with the motocross bike, the police behind me, actually more police cars seen a bit further on even in the port area, the terrorists surely somewhere behind me, of course, still chasing and trying to kill me. 

The satellite pictures, in this precise moment of a hardcore reality, are now the movie kind of scenes full of action. 

Now speeding towards the actual port area, thinking, that the plan what was made to capture the terrorists, to trap and ambush them, is blown up in to the sky. There are too many unwanted factors in this game now.

The police, lots of the police cars, apparently lots of more police and other security forces rushing up to arrive here, just right now…

Yep, the police are so unwanted factor now.

And another annoying fact is that I’m way too early here, even hours. And that means that whatever was the plan, additional resources on our side, our backup guys, are hardly anywhere even close here yet.

And that means that I’m pretty much alone here, with all these mind-meddling real-time factors. And maybe the worst in all is that I’ve got absolutely zero time to consider and make plans. It’s all about high-speed chase, present, happening just right now.

And the only option left for me is, improvise.

Now, when going to drive over a little bridge to get onto the other side of the river, I see that it has been blocked by the police car on the other side.

The next chance is to try and old railway bridge just next to the Puente De Hierro, and as seeing a bit more freeway there, turning now towards to it, I see I got a little chance to get onto the other side. 

I must get onto the other side. The plan is still on and I’ll have to go to the certain cargo ship in the harbor. And I can only hope that our guys have done their job, preparations, been early enough… But I doubt it, as the plan was to deploy it when the night falls.

It all was supposed to happen at night, next night. And the whole thing, ending to this long chase, was supposed to be dealt between us and the terrorists. And now, there are too many people here, too much traffic, and too much polices, everywhere…

As seeing many more police cars in the certain spots, kind of looking like securing the place, I start to understand that something else is wrong as well.

Now passing by the railway bridge onto the other side, seeing the policemen next to the police car blocking another bridge only about fifty meters away, looking at me and the police cars behind me, being amazed.

And at the same time when speeding up again, straight forward, I see from the mirror how the car blocking the bridge moves to open the way for the police cars behind me.

And even more bothering than that is the fact that it looks like there are police cars all over the place, seemingly blocking all the ways anywhere here. It’s odd I think, there is about zero possibility that the police would have know anything about our plans to come here. And that’s seriously worrying me now.

Now, when going to go towards the road leading onto the other side of the port, I realize that it’s completely blocked by the police. And that’s why I have to turn back, now heading off to a large port dock.

I’m trying to figure out some chances to get onto the other side, and it seems that the whole plan has failed now, miserably failed.

Then when seeing a very large luxury cruise ship on the other side of the port, actually close to that cargo ship which was our setup point, the whole thing starts looking like a catastrophe to us.

There must be some huge event here, some very important conference full of very important people, maybe politicians, maybe even the presidents and the most important leaders. Who knows if the American President has arrived here? At least all the security arrangements seem to be in a category like that.

And as thinking of that, it all makes the game plan even worse… The port was supposed to be empty, but now it’s complete opposite. We were supposed to be able to deploy the plan “in peace”, catch the terrorists, at least some of them alive, and to find out that what has been going on.

I hit the brakes on and stop the bike…

Now looking at the other side, seeing it absolutely full of cars and the people, and already seeing how it looks like everybody starts moving there… Oh, yes, they must suppose that there is some attack here, again, and that I’m the attacker.

Is it any wonder regarding to the terrorist attack which just happened in the Plaza Mayor, and I’m coming straight from there…

And now, it looks like there is a total chaos exploding there. So, what now? Should I withdraw myself, pull out, and just try to escape from the police, and the terrorists? 

The fact is that the situation has gone from very bad to even worse. And it’s getting even worse than that when I see the police cars coming towards me, then braking, stopping, the policemen jumping out from their cars, now pointing their handguns at me…

One thing is absolutely sure, I gotta go now!

Turning the gas full on, now speeding up towards the ramp I see, the boat ramp down straight to the water…

Only a hundred meters more and I get on it, now riding along it, the speed still accelerating, from 80 km an hour to hundred…

At the moment I reach the waterline, realizing that the ride over the water is going to be bumpy, maybe way too bumpy. 

Now speeding along the water surface, the gas fully on, the bike is making little jumps already because of the waves. Even though the water is very calm and the waves are small, it’s too much for this kind of ride. 

The bike starts getting wild, being too bumpy ride, and I start loosing the chance to get over into the other side. I have done about eighty meters, but actually into the wrong direction now, as the waves are making the bike uncontrollable. I’m just kind of following it, trying to get as close the other side as possible.

At the same time I notice two jet-skis approaching me from the side, and one more a bit behind them, all coming fast towards me. They are apparently the security forces, so there is zero chance that I would shoot at them. And even if they would look like the terrorists, I have zero chance to shoot at anyone, as the bike is getting totally out of control now. I know that the end of this ride is just right about there.

Realizing that I’m going to fail… 

Thinking of losing the chance to get onto the other side, into a little cargo ship which is kind of waiting for me, the one which was our trap point for the terrorists… 

Thinking how the plan was to arrange me a set of diving gears along with the diver’s scooter for a submerged dive, being my planned escape route…

Seeing the three jet-skis getting closer, the motocross bike going to take the last jump and then sink in any moment, me surely being captured… The whole thing seems like a big, big failure now.

    • “Fuck!”


























CHAPTER 29


Suddenly, I realize that there is a jet-ski just behind me, on my right side, and that it’s approaching me fast, in a moment when the bike is starting to sink still being in full speed. 

The back wheel is starting to get deeper, the speed slowing down fast, a big splash going to be my next and final action…

But then, suddenly, surprisingly, I can hear a familiar voice, shouting:

    • Jump, I’ll get you!

It’s Rosa I realize, the first joy being the fact that she is alive, and the next that I may have a chance. I blink onto my right side, now putting my feet onto the bike’s seat, bouncing hard, and jumping onto the back of the Rosa’s jet-ski, successfully.

She is turning the gas full on, at the same time turning towards to the port exit, yelling:

    • We pull you out, it’s done, must go!
    • Let’s try to get away from here.

But then, both of us, realize that there are couple of patrol boats in front of us, and two more coast guard jet-skis in addition to those already behind us, and she has to turn back, taking a sharp turn to the right.

But the other skis are clearly going to block us, and as the weight of two of us on one jet-ski is slowing us down, and as they are only one on one riding, thus being much faster than we are… And especially now when I can see them having their guns pulled out.

I shout at Rosa:

    • Turn to the right and take me to the dock there, the one where the trap is!
    • I jump of and you must try to escape!
    • Is the underwater scooter there?!

She replies with yelling only one word:

    • Negative!

“Shit!” I think, and I confirm my deep thought to her too:

    • Fuck!

Then shouting and adding:

    • But take me there anyway!
    • I’ll find a way out!

She’s now heading towards the ship which was our planned trap point for the terrorists. It was perfect for the purpose, as the docking is a bit away from the actual large breakwater road, only parking area being close to it.

There is a local Yacht Club, “Real Club Mediterraneo” there, and all of their fancy facilities, but the distance to there was considered safe enough. But anyway, the plan has been dumped now and the only thing to do is to find a way out, to escape.

At the same time when Rosa is reaching close enough to the cargo ship, and I’m just about going to jump off to leave the ride with her, she yells at me:

    • Good Luck!

I’m already in the air, being too late to say “you too”, I splash into the water. 

Now climbing up the rope ladders hanging on the side of the ship, seeing Rosa speeding up and trying to get away from the jet-skis, two of them coming now towards me, their guns pointing at me… Now their bullets starting to snap into the steel, annoyingly too close...

Just a few seconds later, still alive and surprisingly without additional bullet holes in my body, thankful for that, now climbing over the cargo ship’s edge, boarding onto the deck…

Being ready to confront anyone, terrorists, or anyone, I see the whole deck being empty. My options being very few, the reality gotten too hard and harsh for me, once again, I have only one thing on my mind… Survival!

Once again, it’s all about survival.

There are way too many people and the cars there where the cruise ship and the entire cruise terminal are. And that means that it’s out of the question for me now. And it’s a way too big chaos there already now.

The only option for me is to run towards to the Real Club Mediterraneo, it possibly being less crowded now, and thus maybe a way out somewhere there. Maybe I can highjack another bike or even boat on the other side of the breakwater, to get out from there.

But then, something very disturbing blinks in my eye, in the corner of my right eye… Little red dots, two of them! And actually now when looking at to that direction, I can see even more of them… reacting typically to me…

“Fuck!” 

Realizing, that they have loaded the cargo ship with explosives! And they are the terrorists. They have managed to set up a trap for me and our guys. How can they always be one step ahead of us? 

I take an instant hike, running as fast as I can towards the other side and railing of the ship. Two more long leaps and I jump straight over the reeling, with a long fly towards to the concrete ground.

At the same time the whole ship seems to explode behind me, a huge fireball almost covering me and hiding me inside of it. The explosion is massive, being series of explosions all at the same time. 

And for me, it’s about five meter’s free fall down, straight to the concrete.

I take the hit with my legs, giving up in a way that it slows down the impact, falling down frontwards at the same, making a perfect summersault, only one, ending up back on my feet, now starting to run.

It was a perfect jump, done by the playbook I think, at the same time as I see a bicycle on the left. I turn towards it, check the lock, take the gun from under my belt, and hit the lock with the magazine handle, only once, and it breaks the lock. 

Jumping on the Rock Rider, speeding up as fast as I can, seeing lots of people here, everywhere, two police cars, some police men… 

“Shit!”

Both ways, the one towards to the town and the one towards to the Cruise Terminal, are both blocked, completely blocked. And the only way out seems to be over the breakwater, even though that behind it, there is only the sea, and behind the sea, Africa.

The breakwater is a massive wall, five meters tall, a huge concrete construction, hundreds of meters long, built to protect the harbor from the biggest waves the sea can form and roll towards it. The whole construction, described by one word, is “massive”.

I see a concrete construction supporting the breakwater. Stylish curving columns, in the perfect line only about twenty meters away from the next, hundreds of them alongside the massive breakwater. 

I’ll have to get there, I think. But on the way there I will pass the Cruise Terminal, and before being able to do so, there is a complete block, three police cars forming a barricade, preventing anyone getting in or out.

Straight ahead towards a little yacht harbor. I can see the sign Real Club Mediterraneo, thinking, that I’ll pay a visit then. I jump off from the bike, it being my turn to carry the bike now. Next running along the rocks while carrying the bike, jumping from one to the other, straight into the end of a rocky yacht mooring construction…

Only a little problem to overtake, just a short distance to swim. Now pulling the bike in the water with me, reaching the rocks on the other side, then hopping on the ride again, now speeding up pedaling as fast as I can, again…

Now riding with the bike towards the one particular column, getting as much speed as I can, taking a jump from a little ramp next to the big trash containers next to the column… One more jump, the longest one, now riding up along the column.

I’m reaching the ridge of the breakwater, stopping for a moment, now looking to the left towards to the town, then to the right along at least half a kilometer long breakwater’s bridge, leading to the end point of it, to the furthest point from the harbor.

It’s looking like a perfect surface, kind of a mountain ridge to me, I start driving along it, speeding up towards to the end point.

What would be the best than to end this chase in the end of it, I think.

I start a long ride along the breakwater’s bridge, looking towards the Cruise Terminal. It’s a total chaos there, the people screaming, the security trying to direct the people, an apparent terrorist attack the biggest fear for all.

I’m passing by the Cruise Terminal feeling sorry. Still speeding up the speed along the breakwater’s ridge, it looking like a perfect highway for the off-road bikes, on the seaside a huge rock blocks about five meters down, and on the port’s side a road maybe seven meters fall down in a case of falling. 

In front of me, over half a kilometer long and a few meters wide concrete construction, being an ideal flat highway for the off-road bikes, leading off towards to the sea horizon…

But suddenly, someone is firing at me with the machine guns. And when I look at them, the two Dodge vans driving on the road down there, the words burst out from my mouth:

    • What a hell?!
    • How can those bastards be here?!

Suddenly, a new plan forming on my mind…

These guys must be seriously mad, I think. They are ready to risk anything to catch me and to kill me. 

But why? What’s sense in that? 
Just for retaliation?

But the fact is that they seem to have the best ever resources, and apparently, they are unbelievable bold. Maybe they are so confident based on their resources that they can do anything they like. And maybe they have got better plans, with guaranteed escape options.

Now riding along the ridge, seeing how the first Dodge van is crashing through the gates blocking the entrance to the road alongside the massive breakwater.

Thinking, that we are all heading now towards to the end, the end point…
















CHAPTER 30


The terrorists now following, but why they stopped firing? Maybe they think that there is the end for me, the point where they will catch me, and apparently kill me.

The breakwater ridge ride to this direction is leading only into one place, and it’s the end point. After that there is only the sea there.

I’m just about to reach the end point, a quite large part of the breakwater. But then, when I see a helicopter in front of me, flying low, I realize why they stopped from firing at me. There are even bigger guns there. And just right in a moment of that terrible realization, the two 50 caliber machine guns start peppering at me, all around me.

And just in a moment I’m going to get onto the narrow bridge leading from the breakwater ridge into the rooftop of the building, the bullet hits the front wheel. I fall down over the steering column, and this time I roll over a couple of times, on a hard concrete, in fully uncontrollable way.

I hurt myself, pretty bad. And the big bullets of the 50 cal guns are peppering the concrete around me, and as there is only one way to survive, I take it.

Now jumping a long leap forward, rolling a perfect summersault twice to avoid the bullets even though it seems all in vain, finally reaching the bridge, then standing up again…

Now running along the bridge, the pullets still peppering around me, and when reaching the rooftop the bullets start getting closer, hitting the roof too close to me. Finally reaching the door, it being the only door away from here… At the same time, realizing, that the only doorway, a thick metal door is locked, with two heavy locks one up and one down.

Kicking it once, as hard as I can, but in vain as it feels like kicking a solid rock… But then the guns fall silent, and I turn to look towards the helicopter, now hanging in the air, its front pointing at me, the pilot looking at me, at the same time smiling.

“Fuck!”

His smirk look too bad for me, and I start running towards to the edge of the rooftop. I know it’s about three stores down, straight to the concrete, but I’ll take it.

At the same time when I’m just about going to jump down, the rockets hit the rooftops surface, two huge explosions at the same time, both sides a little behind me.

The airwave swings me forward, messing up my balance, and if I was too crazy to try to make a “perfect” landing on concrete, from eight meters high rooftop… I can feel the airwave, also realizing that the plan is blown up anyway, as the two hot red huge fireballs are reaching me.

It’s getting too familiar this thing to me I think, at the same time when falling towards to the roof of the terrorist Dodge’s roof.

Yeah, it would be a funny coincidence in some action movie, but that’s happening just right now. And the only thing I can do is to strengthen my body to take the impact. And I smash down, landing on my back first, straight on the Dodge’s roof.

My lungs get smashed too, and the air I had squeezes out. My breath gets frozen forcing me to gasp air, but all in vain.

And just when I thought that it’s impossible to get any worse anymore. I turn my face to the left, just to look straight to the eyes of the terrorist. But there is still a tiny hope living in my soul, and instantly, instinctively, I’m offering him a solution, from less than a meter away, with one bullet in the middle of his eyes, literally.

Then another terrorist on the other side of the car, staring at me, gets the same sentence, also delivered by me. And just right then, the helicopter, now above the building, gets a hit, fired from somewhere. I see it starting to fall down towards to the rooftop. And as looking at it, being frozen still myself, I see how the copter crashed on to the roof, but just slightly, in a way that it starts falling down.

And the worst part in the glory is that it’s falling down towards the very exact Dodge I’m laying on. And, in that very particular moment, both of us, one terrorist who’s taken a firm grip from my handgun hand, being ready to kill me with a big knife on his hand, and me… We got the same idea, escape.

My way is rolling over backwards first, into the ground, then taking a short run, straight over the edge of the breakwater’s car park, in to the sea, plunging through the surface, starting to sink towards the bottom.

And when sinking, I’m thinking, as my last thoughts in my life… that this practice starts to be a bit too familiar too. And just in a moment when I’m practically fainting, at the same time, I’m feeling how someone is taking a firm grip from my arm. It’s firm, somehow unbelievably firm, but sweet…

Someone, accompanied with another, which is now putting a scuba-diving mask on my face, start to transport my almost death body, by the underwater scooter. 

At the same time when I’m gasping air, I can hear, with crystal clear crystal sound, how Rosa’s the most beautiful voice in this world, is telling me:

    • We got ya!
